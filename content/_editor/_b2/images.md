## Adding Images

To use images in Mockups, **add an Image control from the UI Library** and place it on the canvas. The Image drop-down in the Property Inspector will allow you to select images that have already been imported/used in your mockup or import a new one.

The Project Assets panel shows all images in your assets. If you have Site/Account assets, a tab will appear for them. If you use web images or images using relative paths that are not project assets, those will show in the Other Assets tab. On the desktop, you'll also see a handy link to open the Account Assets folder when you click on the Account Assets tab.

Click the plus icon in the upper right corner of the drop-down to choose a new image, or just double-click on the Image UI control to quickly bring up the image browser dialog. You can choose images from your hard drive or networked drive, or from the Web or Flickr. Mockups supports GIF, JPG/JPEG, and PNG image file formats.

If you are working on a saved file, you can also just drag an image from your computer to the Mockups canvas.

To rotate an image after it's been imported, click the rotate icon next to the Image drop-down in the Property Inspector. To convert an image to a black and white line drawing version, click the "Sketch It" checkbox in the image import dialog or the Property Inspector.

To revert an image to the default placeholder image, click the icon in the upper left corner of the image drop-down (the square with an 'x' inside it).

The image properties panel also allows you to crop or mask images to only show a selected portion of them. You can [watch a tutorial on cropping images here](https://support.balsamiq.com/tutorials/croptool/). Images that have been cropped will show an icon to remove the cropping in the properties panel.

Aside from the Image control, you can also embed images in the Cover Flow control.

## Copying Images to Assets

When you add images to Mockups, what we suggest is that you also add them to "project assets" so they will stay organized with the project and may be re-used in other mockups.

Here's how:

*   If your Mockup isn't saved, Save your Mockup.
*   Add an image to your Mockup.
*   In the lower left corner of the Property Inspector, check "Copy to Project Assets" so this image will stay organized with the project and can be re-used in other mockups.

After you add an image, it will be available in the Property Inspector.

## Using Images as Custom Icons

Mockups also allows you to import your own icons. Importing an image with "icon_" at the front of the file name will make it appear in the Icon Library, under the Project Assets category.
