The Full Screen Presentation Mode is great for presenting your wireframes to stakeholders or usability testing.

To enter it, just click on the full-screen icon in the top-right corner of your [toolbar](../overview/#the-toolbar), select "Full Screen Presentation" from the View menu or simply hit CTRL/CMD+F.

The application will expand to take up your whole screen, with your wireframe centered on it.

The far left icon toggles the top bar on and off. You can turn it off to remove everything but the wireframe (even the icon will disappear until the cursor is placed over it), this is useful for usability testing when you want a more realistic experience.

## Navigating between Wireframes

You can navigate between wireframes using the icons in the upper left. They behave like the navigation icons in the editor [toolbar](../overview/#the-toolbar). The up and down arrows navigate between your wireframes in order, while the icon activated below allows you to jump directly to a specific wireframe.   

If you have created wireframe [alternates](../alternates), a menu will appear when you mouse over the wireframe, allowing you to select and display the alternates. If you are viewing an alternate, its name will appear in parentheses next to the official wireframe name.

If you have created [links](../linking/) between your wireframes, the links will be clickable in full screen presentation mode.

## Settings

By default you will also see a big **blue arrow** pointer in place of the regular mouse cursor. This is useful for presenting your wireframes. The pointer will point towards the center of the screen in order to always stay out of the way of your wireframe as much as possible.

You can turn off the big blue arrow in the full screen settings by clicking the gear icon in the top right to open the settings panel.

The settings panel also has an option to turn on and off **link hints**. When link hints are on areas that contain [links](../linking/) will be shown with a pink overlay so they can be seen easily.

The **Markup** setting is for showing and hiding [markup](../markup/) elements, such as Sticky Notes, Arrows and Callouts (any control under the "Markup" tab in the UI Library). This is useful if you want to just look at your UI without the annotations that surround it.

The last setting is to set the view to **zoom** out to fit the largest wireframe. All other wireframes will be zoomed relative to the largest wireframe.

There are keyboard shortcuts for each setting, shown next to the setting name in the panel. No modifier key is required in full screen mode (e.g., just L for link hints, not CTRL/CMD+L)

The info icon next to the settings icon will open a panel to view and edit notes for the selected wireframe, just like in normal edit mode.

To exit Full Screen Presentation mode, hit the ESC key or click the icon in the upper right corner.

## Adjusting Your Project's Centering

Full Screen Presentation Mode centers your entire project based on the wireframe that is the tallest, and the wireframe that is the widest. While this normally results in a presentation that is centered (and whose focus doesn't jump around), if you have a wireframe that is a great deal larger than your other wireframes, it may result in your project being off center, or pushed to the top of the screen.

In the Settings panel, you will find a link called **Project Centering Rules**.

Clicking that link will open a window that gives you an overview of the size of all the wireframes in your project. It will show you the longest and widest wireframes in project, and the effective size they are making your project as a whole. The longest wireframe will have its width in red, while the tallest wireframe will have it's height in blue. This should give you a hint as to what wireframe is causing your project to center incorrectly.

Clicking the checkbox next to the trouble wireframe (or wireframes) will take them out of the centering calculation (and will recalculate the new longest/widest wireframes, adjusting the overall project size).

This should solve any centering issues you may have.
