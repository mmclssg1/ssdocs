Balsamiq Wireframes is designed for collaboration and offers many ways for you to get feedback on your designs. This document outlines a few different ways so that you can pick the right one to fit each situation.

To learn how to work on the same wireframes together, see our article on [Collaborative Editing](../collaborating/).

## Reviewing and Commenting

The "Review and Comment" mode is a great option for anyone who does not need to edit the wireframes. You can easily switch to this mode from the top-right option in the [toolbar](../overview/#the-toolbar).

Notice how the border color around the profile picture switches from green to orange.

The comments panel allows you to collaborate on your designs by sharing feedback asynchronously or, if you prefer, making notes for yourself as you work. A new comment will generate a notification in the toolbar.

### Callouts

You can add Callout markers to indicate specific places in the wireframe where the comments applies. See the image below to learn how.

### Linking to an Alternate Version

You can also add a link to an [alternate version](../alternates/) by using the "Add Link to Alternate" drop-down at the bottom of the comments panel.

### Comment Actions

Once a comment is added, each reviewer can reply to it and like it. You can also edit and delete your own comments.

## Full Screen Presentation Mode

The Full Screen Presentation Mode is great for sharing your wireframes with stakeholders or for usability testing. If you have created [links](../linking) between your wireframes, the links will be clickable.

To enter it, just click on the full-screen icon in the top-right corner of your [toolbar](../overview/#the-toolbar), select "Full Screen Presentation" from the View menu or simply hit CTRL/CMD+F.

The application will expand to take up your whole screen, with your wireframe centered on it. You can learn more about this feature in [Full Screen Presentation Mode](../fullscreen).

## Sharing an Interactive PDF Document

PDFs generated in Balsamiq Wireframes are completely interactive. That means that they not only display your project as you have designed it, they will also respect any [links](../linking) you have added to the project. This is one of the best ways to share your project with collaborators and clients who don't need to make changes.

The PDF will be created in high resolution and with selectable text (good for the reviewers to copy/paste from). More details about exporting to PDF can be found [here](../exporting/#exporting-to-pdf).

## Sharing PNG Images

You can export all of your wireframes to static PNG images, to easily send to clients. You can learn more about exporting to images [here](../exporting/#exporting-to-an-image).
