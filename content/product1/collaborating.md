## Collaborating in Real-Time

Balsamiq Cloud supports real-time collaboration between users. Once two or more users join the same project, every change will be reflected in real-time with everyone. The [toolbar](../overview/#the-toolbar) will show users who have joined the project, and the [permission level](../people/#user-permissions-at-a-glance) they have.

The [navigator panel](../overview/#the-navigator-panel) indicates which wireframes your co-workers are working on by displaying their profile picture there.

Opening the same wireframe will allow you to see your co-worker's edits in real-time.

## Chatting with Other Editors

The Editor Chat feature is a great way to discuss and gather quick feedback while working on a project. The option will appear as soon as two or more users join the same project.

A new chat message will generate a notification in the [toolbar](../overview/#the-toolbar).

Once clicked, the chat window will appear on the bottom-right corner of your browser window. The window can be minimized or closed using the dedicated icons on the top-right.

## Commenting and More

Besides real-time collaboration and chat, Balsamiq Cloud offers many other ways to get feedback on your designs. To learn more about it, see [Sharing and Reviewing](../sharing).

Among those, the Comments Panel is a great alternative to chat, especially since it doesn't require edit permissions.

Comments can be marked as resolved after they are reviewed and addressed. You can add [Callout markers](../sharing/#callouts) to indicate specific places in the wireframe where the comments applies or add a [link to an alternate](../sharing/#linking-to-an-alternate-version) version.

You can learn more about comments in [Reviewing and Commenting](../sharing/#reviewing-and-commenting).
