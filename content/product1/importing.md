## Importing Wireframes from Another Cloud Project

Sometimes you might want to copy or move a wireframe from one project to another. Here is a simple way to do it:

1. Open the two projects (each in its own browser tab or window)
2. In the source project, select the wireframe you want to copy or move.
3. Select all the controls from this wireframe (CTRL/CMD+A) and copy the controls (CTRL/CMD+C)
4. In the target project, paste your controls (CTRL/CMD+V) in a newly created wireframe

That’s it! You may now delete the wireframe from the source project if you wish.

{{% alert warning %}}**Note:** Symbols and images won’t get transferred in this process. You will have to manually add them to the target project.{{% /alert %}}

Alternatively, you can also use the JSON feature, available in the Export menu:

1.  Open the two projects
2.  In the source project, select the wireframe you want to copy or move.
3.  In the Project menu, select **Export > Wireframe to JSON...** This will put a text-based representation of the wireframe in the clipboard.
4.  In the target project, select **Import > Wireframe JSON...** from the Project menu.
5.  In the dialog that pops up, paste the content of the clipboard with CTRL/CMD+V and click the Import button.

## Importing from Other Versions of Balsamiq

If you have a project created in another Balsamiq product (using the .bmpr extension), you can directly upload your project to your Balsamiq Cloud Space, as detailed [here](../projects/).

Another easy way to import it is to create a new project and use the "Project > Import > Import from BMPR.." option.

## Importing from myBalsamiq

If you are using myBalsamiq and would like to move your wireframes to Balsamiq Cloud, here is the way to download a project from your myBalsamiq project page:

The option is also available from your myBalsamiq home page:

![](//media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/myb/project-download-BMPR-home.png)

The “Download BMPR” option will create a BMPR file from your myBalsamiq project and downloads it to your computer. You can then directly upload your file as a [project](../projects/) in Balsamiq Cloud.
