## What Is Balsamiq Cloud?

Balsamiq Cloud is a web-based user interface design tool for creating [wireframes](https://support.balsamiq.com/resources/whatarewireframes/) (sometimes called mockups or low-fidelity prototypes). You can use it to generate digital sketches of your idea or concept for an application or website, to facilitate discussion and understanding before any code is written. The completed wireframes can be used for user testing, clarifying your vision, getting feedback from stakeholders, or getting approval to start development.

Here's a quick demonstration of how it works.

### Quick Start Guide

1. To get started, you first need to **sign up** at **[balsamiq.cloud](https://balsamiq.cloud/)** and then [**create** a new Space](../spaces/) or **join** an existing one by [invitation](../people/#inviting-someone-to-a-project).

1. Next, **create a project** by clicking the Create a New Project or [Upload Project](#transitioning-from-a-previous-version) buttons, or join one that you have been invited to. A project is a set of wireframes that pertain to a specific product or feature.

{{% alert info %}}**Tip:** Larger projects can be broader in scope, but may be harder to manage. One project may be appropriate for an entire new product that needs to be fleshed out, but more mature products typically have one project per feature or release. {{% /alert %}}

1. Depending on how you work (or your [role](../people/) on the project), you can also **[invite collaborators](../people/#inviting-someone-to-a-project)** to edit or review the wireframes as you build them. Balsamiq Cloud supports [real-time collaboration, comments, and chat](../collaborating/), so that multiple people can work on the same project together. Click the "manage project members..." icon to add collaborators or get a [public link](../sharing/#public-sharing) to share.

1. Once you've created a project, the fun begins when you **create your wireframes**. Drag and drop, edit, and arrange over 75 user interface control types to create anything you can imagine. Read about [adding and arranging](../adding-controls/) and [editing controls](../editing-controls/) to learn how to create your wireframes.  
{{% alert info %}}**Tip:** If you've never used a Balsamiq product before, you might want to follow our tutorial on [how to create your first wireframe](//support.balsamiq.com/tutorials/firstwireframe/).{{% /alert %}}

1. Once you are ready to **share your wireframes** with clients or stakeholders, you can send a [private](../sharing/#sharing-with-team-members) or [public link](../sharing/#public-sharing), or [exporting to PDF](../exporting/#exporting-to-pdf) or [images](../exporting/#exporting-to-an-image).

## What's New

If you have used a Balsamiq product before, the overall experience should be familiar, yet also new.

Balsamiq Cloud brings the **collaborative editing** features from our web-based myBalsamiq product to the **updated editor** from our Desktop version, and adds new **communication** and **review** capabilities such as [chat, comments, and review mode](../collaborating/).

## Transitioning from a Previous Version

If you are transitioning from Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop (or another version that uses .bmpr files), you can simply drag and drop to [upload your files](../projects/).

If you are using myBalsamiq, you can export your projects to .bmpr format and then upload them to Balsamiq Cloud. [Click here to learn how](../importing/#importing-from-mybalsamiq).

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** Do you need to convert some BMML files (old format) so they can be used in Balsamiq Cloud?

Please email us at [support@balsamiq.com](mailto:support@balsamiq.com) and we'll be happy to convert them for you.{{% /alert %}}

## Next Steps

The rest of our documentation contains a top-to-bottom description of the features and use of Balsamiq Cloud. A good starting point would be [People and Permissions](../people/), to get familiar with how to add people to your projects, followed by the [Editor Overview](../overview/), to learn about the user interface for navigating and creating your wireframes.

For troubleshooting, frequently-asked questions, and tutorials, head over to our **[support site](//support.balsamiq.com)**. There, you can learn about pricing and payment information, contact us, watch tutorials, and connect with the user community.

Happy Wireframing, from the Balsamiq team!
