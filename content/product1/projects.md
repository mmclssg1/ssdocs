In each of your Spaces, you will find a collection of projects that you and your team are working on.

From this page you can create and upload as many projects as your [subscription](//support.balsamiq.com/sales/cloud/) allows. If you have existing Balsamiq (.bmpr) files you can just **drag them on to this screen to upload** them.

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** If you were invited to join a Space, it is likely that there will be projects available to you already. If not, ask the person who invited you to [add you to the project](../people/#managing-user-permissions-on-projects). {{% /alert %}}

When you click on the "Create Project" button, you will immediately be taken to the [Balsamiq Wireframes editor](../overview/), to get started wireframing right away. When you are done (or want to take a break), your work will be waiting for you on your projects home page.

To edit a project, just click on it to load the [Balsamiq Wireframes editor](../overview/).

## Cloning, Downloading, and Deleting Projects

From your projects homepage, you can Clone, Download, or Delete projects (depending on your [permissions](../people/)). You'll find these options on the top-right corner of the project's card (or the far right, if viewing as a list).

Downloading and deleting can also be done with multiple projects at once. Clicking on the check box for the project will select it, and you can do this with as many projects as you want. When projects have been "checked", a set of options will appear in the upper right corner of the screen. They will allow you to download or delete the selected projects.

## Managing Project Count

Because your Balsamiq Cloud subscription allows for a finite amount of projects, managing their number can become very important. In this case, we suggest you do the following:

1. Download your project so that you have a copy of it on your hard drive.
2. Delete your project from Balsamiq Cloud.
3. Back up the downloaded project.

We cannot tell you what the best way for you to backup your project is. We recommend signing up for a cloud storage service (like [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) or [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com)) and storing the project files there, but you should use whatever method you are most comfortable with.
