A Space on Balsamiq Cloud is where your projects live. We have [three tiers of Spaces](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#cloud), and we think that once you find the right size, a single Space will be enough for you and your team. While there may be situations where you are invited to someone else's Space to collaborate on a project, or you need [a specific number of projects](http://support.balsamiq.com/sales/cloudsavemoney/), we expect you'll only have to manage a single Space.

## Creating a New Space

If you log into Balsamiq Cloud with an account that doesn't yet belong to a space, you will be prompted to [create a new Space](#creating-a-new-space).

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** If you already have access to one or more Spaces, you will see them listed when you log in. To access an existing Space, simply click on it, and you will be brought to that Space's [project page](../projects/).{{% /alert %}}

To create a new Balsamiq Cloud Space, **click the plus button in the upper left corner** of your Spaces Homepage.

A screen will pop up asking you to name the Space.

Give your Space a name and click the **Create Space & Start Free Trial** to create it.

## Managing Your Space Settings

Once in your Space, you can access the Space settings by clicking the **Settings** link at the top of the page. From this page you can change/add [Space Owners](../people/#space-owners) or delete the Space completely.

### Changing and Adding Space Owners

In Balsamiq Cloud, you can specify up to two [Space Owners](../people/#space-owners) per Space. By default, the Space's creator will be Space Owner, but that can be changed by selecting another [Staff Member](../people/#staff-members) from the dropdown.

You can specify a second Space Owner via the second dropdown. A second Space Owner can be great for sharing the administrative load!

### Deleting Your Balsamiq Cloud Space

Deleting a Space can only be done by the [Space Owner](../people/#space-owners). To do this, type the name of the Space and click the **Delete Space** button. If you have an active subscription for the Space, deleting the Space will cancel it.

{{% alert warning %}}**Note:** Deleting a Space cannot be undone. All of your project data will be deleted immediately, with no way to recover it. {{% /alert %}}

## Managing Users

Clicking the **People** link at the top of the page will show a list of all the users of the Space and the projects they belong to. Click on the number of projects they belong to to see a list.

Add users by entering one or more email addresses in the box at the bottom of the page.

### Making Someone a Staff Member

Checking the "Staff" checkbox will make someone a Staff Member, allowing them to create and own projects. See [People and Permissions](../people/#staff-members) to learn more about their privileges.

### Making Someone a Billing-Only Administrator

Space Owners have the option to invite somebody else to become their Billing-Only Administrator. This person will **ONLY** have access to the Billing Settings of the Space.

This means that Billing-Only Administrators will not be able to participate in projects, or even see them at all. This is useful if you want a **reseller** - or someone from your **purchasing team** - to be able to manage your Space's billing without actively participating.

To make someone your Billing-Only Administrator, make sure they are currently _not_ listed as a Staff Member, Project Member or Space Owner, then visit your Space's Settings. Scroll down to the Billing-Only Administrator section and enter the email address of the person you'd like to invite.

### Deleting Users

To remove a person from the Space, click the **X** to the far right of their name. They will no longer be able to access any projects, except those that allow [public (anonymous) reviews](../people/#allow-public-reviews).
