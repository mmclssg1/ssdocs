## The Local Store Folder

Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop creates a folder on your hard drive for storing some local data and preferences. It looks something like this:

The easiest way to find it is by opening the "About" dialog and clicking on the "Open Local Store Folder" link.

For reference, here is the location of this folder on the various operating systems that Balsamiq Mockups for Desktop runs on:

* **On Windows XP:** C:\Documents and Settings\\\<username>\Application Data\BalsamiqMockups3.EDE15CF69E11F7F7D45B5430C7D37CC6C3545E3C.1\Local Store
* **On Windows Vista and later:** C:\Users\\\<yourusername>\AppData\Roaming\BalsamiqMockups3.EDE15CF69E11F7F7D45B5430C7D37CC6C3545E3C.1\Local Store
* **On Mac OS X:** <your user home>/Library/Preferences/BalsamiqMockups3.EDE15CF69E11F7F7D45B5430C7D37CC6C3545E3C.1/Local Store


{{% alert info %}}**Note:** On macOS 10.7 and Beyond: the ~/Library folder is hidden by default. You can access it by opening a Finder window, clicking on the "Go" menu option at the top of your screen, and then pressing the "alt/option" key on your keyboard. That will make the Library folder selectable in the dropdown menu.{{% /alert %}}

### Unhiding System Files in Windows

In Windows 7, if you don't see Documents and Settings, you may need to "unhide system files." Here are the steps to do that:

1. Open Windows Explorer (Start+E)
2. Select the menu item "Organize > Folder and search options."
3. Select the View tab, and uncheck "Hide protected operating system files."

Documents and Settings should show up under C:\ in your Windows Explorer now. If it doesn't, you may need to restart.

Mockups 3 for Desktop backs up any file you open to a local folder. These local versions are stored for (around) seven days and should automatically load in case of a corrupted project file.

Versions of [Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://balsamiq.com/download) prior to 3.4 do not have the automatic recovery feature. This FAQ will show you how to recover the file manually.

## Backups

Backups are stored in the Local Storage folder in two folders.

* **The LocalProjects Folder**: The LocalProjects folder is for projects that you have saved at least once. We keep projects in this folder for about a week before deleting them.

* **The UnsavedProjects Folder**: The UnsavedProjects folder is for projects that you haven't had a chance to save yet, but have been working on. Check here if you re-opened Mockups 3 for Desktop, but your new project didn't open up with it.

### Restoring Backups

Check both the **LocalProjects** and **UnsavedProjects** folders for your project. You may have to open a couple of different projects to find a working or up-to-date version. Once you have found and opened it, Select Project > Save As and save the file in a new location. Saving it allows both the backup and a new version of the file to exist, which keeps your data safe!

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** We do not recommend moving files out of the Local Store folder. If you want to move a backed up file to another folder, we recommend copying the file (CTRL/CMD+C), and then pasting it to the destination (CTRL/CMD+V). {{% /alert %}}
