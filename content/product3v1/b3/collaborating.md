Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive supports real-time collaboration between users. Just [share](../drive-files/#sharing-via-google-drive) the Mockups file with your collaborators, then have everyone launch the application on the same file. Everyone's changes will be shared in real-time with all collaborators.
