A variety of actions are available from the Google Drive file viewer. These actions are available by selecting a file and clicking one of the icons at the top of the file viewer or by right-clicking on the file. The actions available on Balsamiq Mockups files in Google Drive are common across all types of files in Google Drive, so not all of them are described here. For general help on getting around in Google Drive, check out the [Google Drive Help Center](https://support.google.com/drive/).

## Sharing via Google Drive

Wireframes created with Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive are saved as .bmpr files that can be shared just like any other document type in Google Drive. To share your mockups select the .bmpr file and click the share button in the Google Drive file viewer (or "More > Share... > Share" in the toolbar).

![Share menu](//media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/gdrive/sharing/gdrive-sharing02.png)

If the Google Drive users you are sharing with do not have Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive installed, they will be prompted to install it. **Remember that viewing mockups with Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive is free, it's only the saving functionality that expires after 30 days. So share away!**

Alternatively, you can export your mockups as PNG images or an interactive PDF and use sharing in Google Drive to allow others to view them. See the [Exporting Your Mockups](../exporting/) for how to export to PNG or PDF.

Once you've shared your mockups with another person you can both work on them at the same time. See [Collaborating with Other Users in Real Time](../collaborating/) for details.
