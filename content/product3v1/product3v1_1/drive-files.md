## Sharing via Google Drive

Wireframes created with Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive are saved as .bmpr files that can be shared just like any other document in Google Drive. To share your wireframes, select the .bmpr file and click the share button in the Google Drive toolbar (or right-click on the file > Share).

You can also share it directly from within the editor, by using the dedicated icon in the toolbar.

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** If you give the other person **“Can view”** or **“Can comment”** permission, they will be able to view and comment your wireframes but not edit them.{{% /alert %}}

On the other users' end, the Balsamiq file appears in “Shared with me” and they can see a preview of it.

- If users have Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive already installed, they can just double-click on the file to open it.

- If they do not have Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive installed, they will be prompted to install it by selecting the "Open with" option from the Google Drive file viewer (see menu [above](../drive-files)). Double-clicking the file will also reveal the "Open with" option on top of the page.

**Remember that viewing wireframes and commenting with Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive is free, it’s only the editing functionality that require a valid subscription after the trial expires. So share away!**

Alternatively, you can export your wireframes to PNG images or to an interactive PDF and use sharing in Google Drive to allow others to view them. See [Exporting Your Wireframes](../exporting/) for more information.

Once you've shared your wireframes with another person, you can both work on them at the same time, as detailed in [Collaborative Editing](../collaborating/).

## Rename, Delete, Copy

To rename, delete, or make a copy of a Balsamiq file, select one of these options from the Google Drive actions menu ([via right-click or the toolbar](../drive-files)).

## Managing Versions

You can see previous versions of your wireframes via the Google Drive interface. Right-click on the .bmpr file, select "Manage Versions..." and you will be presented with a list of old versions. If needed, you can easily download a specific version from the context menu on the right.
