## Importing Wireframes from Another Project

Sometimes you might want to copy or move a wireframe from one project to another. Here is a simple way to do it:

1. Open the two projects (each in its own browser tab or window)
2. In the source project, select the wireframe you want to copy or move.
3. Select all the controls from this wireframe (CTRL/CMD+A) and copy the controls (CTRL/CMD+C)
4. In the target project, paste your controls (CTRL/CMD+V) in a newly created wireframe

That’s it! You may now delete the wireframe from the source project if you wish.

Alternatively, you can also use the JSON feature, available in the Export menu:

1.  Open the two projects
2.  In the source project, select the wireframe you want to copy or move.
3.  In the Project menu, select **Export > Wireframe to JSON...** This will put a text-based representation of the wireframe in the clipboard.
4.  In the target project, select **Import > Wireframe JSON...** from the Project menu.
5.  In the dialog that pops up, paste the content of the clipboard with CTRL/CMD+V and click the Import button.

## Importing from Other Versions of Balsamiq

If you have a project created in another Balsamiq product (using the .bmpr extension), the easiest way to import it is to create a new project and use the "Project > Import > Import from BMPR.." option.
