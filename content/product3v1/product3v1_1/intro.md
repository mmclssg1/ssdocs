## Overview

Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive allows you to add and **edit wireframes directly from Google Drive, where the files are stored and managed**. If you use other Google Drive apps (Google Docs, for example), the file management features should be very familiar to you.

With [easy sharing](../drive-files/#sharing-via-google-drive), version control and even [real-time collaboration](../collaborating/), Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive makes iterating on wireframes easy and fun.

## Creating a New Project

There are two ways to create a new Balsamiq Wireframes project in Google Drive.

1.  You can click **"New > Balsamiq Wireframes"** from the Google Drive file list as shown above.

2.  If you are using the Chrome browser, you can also launch Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive from the Chrome Apps tab (open a new tab and type "chrome://apps/"). Click the big Balsamiq Wireframes icon and it will open the editor directly.

​Either method will launch the Balsamiq Wireframes editor, allowing you to create your wireframes (or [import existing ones](#importing-from-other-versions)).

This will also create a new project file (.bmpr file extension) in your Google Drive. If you launched Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive from the Chrome Apps page, your file will be saved in your Drive’s home folder. Otherwise it will be saved in the folder selected when you created the new Balsamiq Wireframes project.

## Using the Balsamiq Wireframes Editor

The Balsamiq Wireframes editor allows you to create wireframes just like our other products. Start with the [application overview](../overview/) to learn more about using the editor.

## Importing from Other Versions

If you have a project created in another Balsamiq product (using the .bmpr extension), the easiest way to import it is to create a new project and use the "Project > Import > Import from BMPR..." option.

## Returning to Google Drive (Closing the Editor)

When you are done editing your wireframes you can exit the editor by selecting “Back to Google Drive” in the Project menu. This will also create a new version of the file in case you want to revert to it later.

Alternatively, you can perform the same action by clicking on the breadcrumb link pointing to the parent folder of your BMPR project, on the top-left part of the menu bar.
