Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud provides very similar functionality to Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop.

The main difference is that the Balsamiq project files are stored and managed as Confluence Cloud attachments.

## Adding a New Project to a Confluence Page

Adding a new Balsamiq Mockups project to a wiki page is very similar to adding an image.

Edit the page, position the cursor where you’d like your mockups to be, then click on the Insert menu and select “Balsamiq Mockups” from the list.

The link will launch the Balsamiq Mockups editor to allow you to create your mockups (or import existing ones). This will also create a new Balsamiq Mockups file (.bmpr file extension) attached to your wiki page containing all the resources that belong to a project (mockups, symbols, images, icons).

If you do not see the menu item, please check with your Confluence Cloud administrator that the Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud add-on is installed and that you have editing permission on the current page.

## Using the Balsamiq Mockups Editor

The Balsamiq Mockups editor allows you to create wireframes just like our other products. Start with the [application overview](../overview) to learn more about using the editor.

## Collaborating with Other Users in Real Time

Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud supports real-time collaboration between users: just have everyone launch the editor on the same project. Everyone’s changes will be shared in real-time with all collaborators.
