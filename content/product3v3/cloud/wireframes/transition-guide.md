{{% alert info %}}**Note:** This transition guide describes the steps to convert BMML files (old format) to BMPR files. Existing BMPR files will work fine in the new version of the add-on.{{% /alert %}}

A new major version of the Balsamiq add-on for Confluence Cloud was released on January 2018. The new version has projects, symbols, comments, chat, real time collaboration and lots of other improvements.

Here’s a quick, 5-minute video walkthrough for some of the highlights of Balsamiq Wireframes for Confluence Cloud.

## A New File Format

In the old version of Balsamiq for Confluence Cloud, we stored each wireframe in its own BMML attachment, and only linked to images.

Balsamiq Wireframes for Confluence Cloud introduces a new project file format called **BMPR**: everything that belongs to a project (wireframes, symbols, images, icons) is in a single file, saved as an attachment to your Confluence page. This makes it much easier to link and keep everything together. Learn more about the new plugin [here](../intro/).

In order to take advantage of the new features, you need to migrate the old files to the new project format.

## Migrating Your Mockups to the New Plugin

Once the new plugin is installed, trying to edit a Balsamiq Wireframes macro will reveal this migration dialog:

Clicking on "Migrate to Balsamiq Wireframes" shows this message:

To start the conversion process for the BMMLs on this Confluence page, just click the "Migrate to Balsamiq Wireframes” button:

At the end of the migration process, you will be taken to the new version of the Balsamiq Wireframes editor. Just verify that everything is there, then select **Project > Exit Back to Confluence**.

## Backup Copy of Your Old Files

After the migration, your old wireframe and asset files will be kept as attachments. Once the migration completed successfully, you can delete the files or keep them as a backup.
