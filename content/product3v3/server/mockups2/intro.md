## Welcome

This page contains usage instructions for [Mockups for Confluence Server](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.confluence.plugins.mockups/server/overview).

{{% alert info %}}**Using Confluence Cloud?** If you are using Confluence Cloud (on atlassian.net), please see [this article](/confluence/cloud/intro/) instead.{{% /alert %}}

Confluence Server Administrators: the [Mockups for Confluence Server Admin Guide](../admin-guide/) is for you.

## Creating a New Mockup

Adding a mockup to a wiki page is very similar to adding an image.

Edit the page, position the cursor where you'd like your mockup to be, then click on the Insert menu and select "UI Mockup" from the list.

This will take you directly to the Balsamiq Mockup editor, where you can create your mockup (or import an existing mockup).

If you have never used Balsamiq Mockups before, here's a little intro of what you can do with it when using the Confluence Server plugin:

<div class="video"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/l9-dLyINrac?rel=0"></iframe></div>

Once you are happy with your mockup, just select "Save" from the toolbar or the Mockup menu. You will be asked to give it a unique name. This is required and allows you to include more than one mockup on the same page.

Once you name your mockup you can continue working on it and saving it periodically.

When you are ready to go back to the wiki page, just click on "Close" or select "Close Editor" from the Mockup menu. You will be taken back to the Confluence editor. Save the page and you're done!

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** Even if your Balsamiq Mockups license is configured so that only specific people can create and edit mockups (explained in the [Admin Guide](../admin-guide)), anyone with access to your Confluence site will be able to see them.{{% /alert %}}

## Editing a Mockup

To make changes to a mockup, edit the wiki page, select the mockup image and click on the "Edit" button in the little macro control panel that shows up.

## Deleting a Mockup

To remove a mockup from a page, simply edit the page, select the mockup and delete it or click on "Remove".

* * *

## Looking at a Mockup's History

Each UI mockup is saved as two separate attachments, one for the PNG image and one for the BMML source data. Confluence supports versioning of attachments, and Balsamiq Mockups takes advantage of it so that you can see how your mockup evolved over time, or roll back to a previous version.

## Rolling Back to a Previous Version of a Mockup

This is a bit tricky but it can be done. Go to the attachments view for your page, find the mockup you want to roll back, get the BMML for the version you want to roll it back to and copy it. Now you can go back to the page, edit the mockup and import your old BMML via the "Import" dialog.

* * *

## Moving a Mockup on a Page

To move a mockup to a different location on a page you edit the page, select it in the editor and use cut and paste to move it to another location on the page. Save the page and you're done!

* * *

## Aligning a Mockup on a Page

If you'd like to left-align or right-align the mockup's image relative to your page, you can do so via the macro control panel. Note that the macro won't align while in edit mode, but it will show up with the right alignment once you save the wiki page.

* * *

## Specifying the Size of a Mockup on a Page

You can use the "Small", "Medium" and "Original" buttons in the macro property panel.

* * *

## Adding an Existing Confluence Mockup to a New Confluence Page

You may want to add a mockup that you've already created in Confluence to a different page than you initially created it for. Right now you can only add mockups that are attached to the same page. However, you can create a copy of the mockup you want and add it to the new page. The fastest way to do that is via Export/Import. This process involves exporting from the old one and importing into a new one. You can also see the steps [below](#moving-a-mockup-from-one-page-to-another) for moving a mockup from one page to another.

* * *

## Moving a Mockup from One Page to Another

It is possible to move mockups from one page to another. However, this is somewhat of an "advanced" feature, so it's not as easy as the tasks described above.

Here are the steps:

1.  Go to the Attachments page and move _both_ the .bmml and .png files (both file types should have a "mockup\_" prefix) to the page you wish to move the mockup to (_refer to [the Confluence documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/search/?query=moving%20an%20attachment%20) for more information_).
2.  On the new page, Edit the page and type the following text:
    1.  **{mockup:Name=**
    2.  *the name of the mockup without the "mockup\_" prefix or the .bmml extension (so "mockup\_login screen.bmml" would become "**login screen**")*
    3.  **}**  
    resulting in something like this **{mockup:Name=login screen}**.
3.  After doing this, you should see your mockup appear in the editor.

This process can also be useful if you have removed a mockup from a page and want to re-add it. In that case, skip step 1 and follow steps 2-4.

## Renaming a Mockup

Similar to the process described above, renaming a mockup is possible, but you have to go behind the scenes to do it.

Here are the steps:

1.  Go to the Attachments page and rename _both_ the .bmml and .png files (click on Properties and change the file name). Make sure to keep the "mockup\_" prefix for both files.
2.  Go back to the page the mockup was on (you should see an error where it used to be).
3.  Edit the page, then delete the macro placeholder for the old mockup name.
4.  In its place, type the following text:
    1.  **{mockup:Name=**
    2.  *the name of the renamed mockup without the "mockup\_" prefix or the .bmml extension (so "mockup\_new name.bmml" would become "**new name**")*
    3.  **}**  
    resulting in something like this **{mockup:Name=new name}**.
5.  After doing this, you should see your mockup appear in the editor.

## Exporting a Mockup

Mockups for Confluence Server allows you to export your mockup to XML format so that you can import it to our other versions. It is not currently possible to export directly to PDF or an image (PNG, etc.) from the Balsamiq Mockups editor.

As [mentioned above](#looking-at-a-mockup-s-history), however, you can access your mockups in **PNG image** format by going to the **attachments** for the Confluence page.

You can also take advantage of the ability to **export to PDF** within Confluence to export your wiki page, including any mockups, to PDF.
