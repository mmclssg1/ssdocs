## A New File Format

In the old version of Balsamiq Mockups for Confluence Server, we stored each mockup in its own BMML attachment, and only linked to images.

Balsamiq Wireframes for Confluence Server introduces a new project file format called **BMPR**: everything that belongs to a project (wireframes, symbols, images, icons) is in a single file, saved as an attachment to your Confluence page. This makes it much easier to link and keep everything together. Learn more about the new plugin [here](../intro/).

In order to take advantage of the new features, you need to migrate the old files to the new project format.

## Migrating Your Wireframes to the New Plugin
