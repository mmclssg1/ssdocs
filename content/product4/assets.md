**1\. Site Assets**
 Site Assets are files which will be available for use across all of your projects. You can access the Site Assets manager from the home page. If you access the Assets Manager from projects pages, you will see both a Project Assets and Site Assets tab in the assets manager dialog.

**2\. Project Assets**
 Project Assets are files which are available only to mockups within a single project. You can access the Project Assets manager from the main Project page in grid, story, and map views, or from a single Mockup view. When you open the Assets Manager from any of these views, you will notice that you will see that projectâ€™s assets in the Project Assets tab, but can also see the site assets in the Site Assets tab.

The Assets Manager dialog is show below. This screenshot was opened from a project, so it is showing both Site Assets and Project Assets.
