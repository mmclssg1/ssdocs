## Exporting to PDF

Unlike the Desktop version, exporting to PDF from myBalsamiq is done outside of the [Editor](/mybalsamiq/editor/).

To export to PDF in myBalsamiq, go to the **[Project page](/mybalsamiq/project/)** for the mockups you want to export and click the **arrow next to the Edit button** as shown below.

You will see an option listed there to **export to PDF**. When you select it you will be presented with some options and when you click the "Export to PDF" button the file will be created for you to download.

If you want to export a **single mockup** to PDF, you can go to the [Single Mockup page](/mybalsamiq/mockup/) and print to PDF from the browser print dialog (e.g., File > Print).
