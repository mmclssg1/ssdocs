    "tags": [],
    "description": "",
    "content": " What Is Balsamiq Cloud? Balsamiq Cloud is a web-based user interface design tool for creating wireframes (sometimes called mockups or low-fidelity prototypes). You can use it to generate digital sketches of your idea or concept for an application or website, to facilitate discussion and understanding before any code is written. The completed wireframes can be used for user testing, clarifying your vision, getting feedback from stakeholders, or getting approval to start development.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a quick demonstration of how it works.\n Quick Start Guide  To get started, you first need to sign up at balsamiq.cloud and then create a new Space or join an existing one by invitation.\n Next, create a project by clicking the Create a New Project or Upload Project buttons, or join one that you have been invited to. A project is a set of wireframes that pertain to a specific product or feature. Tip: Larger projects can be broader in scope, but may be harder to manage. One project may be appropriate for an entire new product that needs to be fleshed out, but more mature products typically have one project per feature or release.\n Depending on how you work (or your role on the project), you can also invite collaborators to edit or review the wireframes as you build them. Balsamiq Cloud supports real-time collaboration, comments, and chat, so that multiple people can work on the same project together. Click the \u0026ldquo;manage project members\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; icon to add collaborators or get a public link to share.  Once you\u0026rsquo;ve created a project, the fun begins when you create your wireframes. Drag and drop, edit, and arrange over 75 user interface control types to create anything you can imagine. Read about adding and arranging and editing controls to learn how to create your wireframes.\nTip: If you\u0026rsquo;ve never used a Balsamiq product before, you might want to follow our tutorial on how to create your first wireframe.\n Once you are ready to share your wireframes with clients or stakeholders, you can send a private or public link, or exporting to PDF or images.\n  What\u0026rsquo;s New If you have used a Balsamiq product before, the overall experience should be familiar, yet also new.\nBalsamiq Cloud brings the collaborative editing features from our web-based myBalsamiq product to the updated editor from our Desktop version, and adds new communication and review capabilities such as chat, comments, and review mode.\nTransitioning from a Previous Version If you are transitioning from Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop (or another version that uses .bmpr files), you can simply drag and drop to upload your files.\nIf you are using myBalsamiq, you can export your projects to .bmpr format and then upload them to Balsamiq Cloud. Click here to learn how.\nNote: Do you need to convert some BMML files (old format) so they can be used in Balsamiq Cloud?\nPlease email us at support@balsamiq.com and we\u0026rsquo;ll be happy to convert them for you.\n Next Steps The rest of our documentation contains a top-to-bottom description of the features and use of Balsamiq Cloud. A good starting point would be People and Permissions, to get familiar with how to add people to your projects, followed by the Editor Overview, to learn about the user interface for navigating and creating your wireframes.\nFor troubleshooting, frequently-asked questions, and tutorials, head over to our support site. There, you can learn about pricing and payment information, contact us, watch tutorials, and connect with the user community.\nHappy Wireframing, from the Balsamiq team!\n"

    "tags": [],
    "description": "",
    "content": " A Space on Balsamiq Cloud is where your projects live. We have three tiers of Spaces, and we think that once you find the right size, a single Space will be enough for you and your team. While there may be situations where you are invited to someone else\u0026rsquo;s Space to collaborate on a project, or you need a specific number of projects, we expect you\u0026rsquo;ll only have to manage a single Space.\nCreating a New Space If you log into Balsamiq Cloud with an account that doesn\u0026rsquo;t yet belong to a space, you will be prompted to create a new Space.\nNote: If you already have access to one or more Spaces, you will see them listed when you log in. To access an existing Space, simply click on it, and you will be brought to that Space\u0026rsquo;s project page. To create a new Balsamiq Cloud Space, click the plus button in the upper left corner of your Spaces Homepage.\nA screen will pop up asking you to name the Space.\nGive your Space a name and click the Create Space \u0026amp; Start Free Trial to create it.\nManaging Your Space Settings Once in your Space, you can access the Space settings by clicking the Settings link at the top of the page. From this page you can change/add Space Owners or delete the Space completely.\nChanging and Adding Space Owners In Balsamiq Cloud, you can specify up to two Space Owners per Space. By default, the Space\u0026rsquo;s creator will be Space Owner, but that can be changed by selecting another Staff Member from the dropdown.\nYou can specify a second Space Owner via the second dropdown. A second Space Owner can be great for sharing the administrative load!\nDeleting Your Balsamiq Cloud Space Deleting a Space can only be done by the Space Owner. To do this, type the name of the Space and click the Delete Space button. If you have an active subscription for the Space, deleting the Space will cancel it.\nNote: Deleting a Space cannot be undone. All of your project data will be deleted immediately, with no way to recover it. Managing Users Clicking the People link at the top of the page will show a list of all the users of the Space and the projects they belong to. Click on the number of projects they belong to to see a list.\nAdd users by entering one or more email addresses in the box at the bottom of the page.\nMaking Someone a Staff Member Checking the \u0026ldquo;Staff\u0026rdquo; checkbox will make someone a Staff Member, allowing them to create and own projects. See People and Permissions to learn more about their privileges.\nMaking Someone a Billing-Only Administrator Space Owners have the option to invite somebody else to become their Billing-Only Administrator. This person will ONLY have access to the Billing Settings of the Space.\nThis means that Billing-Only Administrators will not be able to participate in projects, or even see them at all. This is useful if you want a reseller - or someone from your purchasing team - to be able to manage your Space\u0026rsquo;s billing without actively participating.\nTo make someone your Billing-Only Administrator, make sure they are currently not listed as a Staff Member, Project Member or Space Owner, then visit your Space\u0026rsquo;s Settings. Scroll down to the Billing-Only Administrator section and enter the email address of the person you\u0026rsquo;d like to invite.\nDeleting Users To remove a person from the Space, click the X to the far right of their name. They will no longer be able to access any projects, except those that allow public (anonymous) reviews.\n"

    "content": " In each of your Spaces, you will find a collection of projects that you and your team are working on.\nFrom this page you can create and upload as many projects as your subscription allows. If you have existing Balsamiq (.bmpr) files you can just drag them on to this screen to upload them.\nNote: If you were invited to join a Space, it is likely that there will be projects available to you already. If not, ask the person who invited you to add you to the project. When you click on the \u0026ldquo;Create Project\u0026rdquo; button, you will immediately be taken to the Balsamiq Wireframes editor, to get started wireframing right away. When you are done (or want to take a break), your work will be waiting for you on your projects home page.\nTo edit a project, just click on it to load the Balsamiq Wireframes editor.\nCloning, Downloading, and Deleting Projects From your projects homepage, you can Clone, Download, or Delete projects (depending on your permissions). You\u0026rsquo;ll find these options on the top-right corner of the project\u0026rsquo;s card (or the far right, if viewing as a list).\nDownloading and deleting can also be done with multiple projects at once. Clicking on the check box for the project will select it, and you can do this with as many projects as you want. When projects have been \u0026ldquo;checked\u0026rdquo;, a set of options will appear in the upper right corner of the screen. They will allow you to download or delete the selected projects.\nManaging Project Count Because your Balsamiq Cloud subscription allows for a finite amount of projects, managing their number can become very important. In this case, we suggest you do the following:\n Download your project so that you have a copy of it on your hard drive. Delete your project from Balsamiq Cloud. Back up the downloaded project.  We cannot tell you what the best way for you to backup your project is. We recommend signing up for a cloud storage service (like Google Drive or Dropbox) and storing the project files there, but you should use whatever method you are most comfortable with.\n"

Inviting Someone to a Project To invite a user to a project, type their name (if they are an existing user) or their email (if they are new user) into the Invite People box. You can invite multiple users this way, just separate their name/emails with commas.\nNote: An invitation link is valid for 3 days. After that, it will expire and the invitation will be unlisted from the pending ones. You can select their access level when you invite by changing the value in the dropdown next to the invite button.\nRemoving Someone from a Project To remove a user from a project, click the X by their permission level.\nAllow Public Reviews Clicking this checkbox will allow anyone to view and comment on the project, including anonymous users that you have shared the project link with.

    "content": " This page contains usage instructions for Mockups 3 for Jira Cloud.\nUsing Jira Server? If you are hosting Jira behind the firewall, please see this article instead. Jira Cloud Administrators: the Mockups 3 for Jira Cloud Admin Guide is for you.\nNote: Mockups 3 for Jira Cloud was released January 18, 2016. See our transition guide if you have the older pre-installed version of Mockups for Jira. Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Jira Cloud provides very similar functionality to Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop.\nThe main difference is that the Balsamiq project files are stored and managed as Jira Cloud attachments.\n Adding a New Project to a Jira Issue To add a new Balsamiq Mockups project to a particular Jira issue you simply click on the “Add Balsamiq Mockups” link.\nThe link will launch the Balsamiq Mockups editor to allow you to create your mockups (or import existing ones). This will also create a new Balsamiq Mockups file (.bmpr file extension) attached to your Jira issue containing all the resources that belong to a project (mockups, symbols, images, icons).\nIf you do not see the link, please check with your Jira Cloud administrator that the Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Jira Cloud add-on is installed and that you have editing permission on the current issue.\nUsing the Balsamiq Mockups Editor The Balsamiq Mockups editor allows you to create wireframes just like our other products. Start with the application overview to learn more about using the editor.\nCollaborating with Other Users in Real Time Mockups 3 for Jira Cloud supports real-time collaboration between users: just have everyone launch the editor on the same project. Everyone’s changes will be shared in real-time with all collaborators.\nThe other connected users will be shown in the top right of the screen. Hovering over their picture shows their Jira username.\nCopying or Moving Mockups between Projects Sometimes you might want to copy or move a mockup from a project to another. To do so, follow the steps below:\n Open the two projects (each in its own browser tab or window) In the source project, select the mockup you want to copy or move. In the Project menu, select Export \u0026gt; Mockup to JSON. This will put a text-based representation of the mockup in the clipboard. In the target project, select Import \u0026gt; Mockup JSON\u0026hellip; from the Project menu. In the Import Mockup dialog that pops up, paste the contents of the clipboard with CTRL+V and click the Import button.  That\u0026rsquo;s it! You may now delete the mockup from the source project if you wish.\nNote: Symbols and images won\u0026rsquo;t get transferred in this process. You will have to manually add them to the new project. Importing from Other Versions of Balsamiq Mockups If you have a project created in Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop (with a .bmpr extension) you can just attach the file to the Jira issue, refresh the page in order to let the Balsamiq Mockups panel appear (see below) and edit it directly.\nIf you want to open a project containing .bmml files (Balsamiq Mockups version 2) go to the “Project \u0026gt; Import ” menu. You will have the option to import mockups from a .zip file, or from individual mockups or symbols. You can find more information in the documentation for importing.\nExporting to Other Versions of Balsamiq Mockups To use your project in Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop all you need to do is download it and open it using the Desktop version. To do this go to \u0026ldquo;Project \u0026gt; Download Project BMPR\u0026rdquo;. This will create a .bmpr to download containing all the mockups, Symbols, and images used in the current project.\nTo use your project in an earlier version of Balsamiq Mockups you can export the entire project as a .zip file. To do this go to “Project \u0026gt; Export \u0026gt; Project to BMMLs ZIP…”. This will create a .zip file for you to download containing all the mockups, Symbols, and images in the current project.\nSaving the Project All the changes made on your project in the editor are always autosaved and visible by the collaborators that are editing in real time the same project.\nHowever the changes made in editing mode (i.e. inside the Balsamiq editor) will not be flushed to the official version that\u0026rsquo;s attached to the Jira issue until the project is expressly saved.\nThis can be done by selecting the “Save” command in the \u0026ldquo;Project\u0026rdquo; menu or by simply closing the editor.\nReturning to Jira (Closing the Editor) When you are done editing your mockups you can exit the editor by selecting “Quit” in the \u0026ldquo;Project\u0026rdquo; menu. This will also save the current project and update the version that will be now visible on the Balsamiq Mockups Panel.\nUsing the Balsamiq Mockups Panel Once you have created a new project, the Balsamiq Mockups Panel will appear on your Jira issue.\nThe panel will show the thumbnails of the mockups contained in the currently saved version of the Balsamiq project.\nA variety of actions are available from the Balsamiq Mockups Panel.\nEditing Existing Mockups There are two ways open the editor from the panel.\n You can click the “edit” icon that is shown when your mouse is over each thumbnail. The editor will open showing the selected mockup. You can click the “Edit” button: the editor will open the project on the first mockup.  Note If you have read-only permission on an issue, you will be still able to access the full screen viewer but you will not be able to edit the mockups. Adding a New Mockup By clicking the “Add” button the editor will open by showing a new mockups named “New Mockup 1”.\nYou can also add mockups directly from within the project editor.\nDeleting the Project If you want to remove a project from the Jira issue you can use the “Delete Project” command. Note that this action can not be undone.\n"

If they do have the app, you can edit your mockups at the same time.\nCreating a New Project There are two ways to create a new Balsamiq Mockups project in Google Drive.\n You can click \u0026ldquo;New \u0026gt; Balsamiq Mockups Project\u0026rdquo; from the Google Drive file list as shown above. If you are using the Chrome browser, you can also launch Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive from the Chrome Apps tab (open a new tab and type \u0026ldquo;chrome://apps/\u0026ldquo;). Click the big Balsamiq Mockups icon and it will open the editor directly.  ​Either method will launch the Balsamiq Mockups editor to allow you to create your mockups (or import existing ones). This will also create a new Balsamiq Mockups file (.bmpr file extension) in your Google Drive. If you launched Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive from the Chrome Apps page your files will be saved in your Drive\u0026rsquo;s home folder. Otherwise they will be saved in the folder you had selected when you created the new Mockups project.\nNote: Your work is always automatically saved on Google Drive as you make edits. To exit the editor, use the \u0026ldquo;Quit\u0026rdquo; command in the Project menu. Using the Balsamiq Mockups Editor The Balsamiq Mockups editor allows you to create wireframes just like our other products. Start with the application overview to learn more about using the editor.\nImporting from Other Versions of Balsamiq Mockups If you have a project created in Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop (with a .bmpr extension) you can just upload it to Google Drive and edit it directly.\nIf you want to open a project containing .bmml files (Balsamiq Mockups version 2) see the documentation on importing mockups from a previous version.\nReturning to Google Drive (Closing the Editor) When you are done editing your mockups you can exit the editor by selecting \u0026ldquo;Quit\u0026rdquo; in the Project menu. This will also create a new version of the file in case you want to revert to it later.\n"

    "content": " Please read this document carefully before accessing or using myBalsamiq.\nIntroduction English, Not Legalese Most Terms of Service and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable. They are written by lawyers and for lawyers, and in our opinion are not very effective.\nBecause we believe in establishing long-term relationships with our customers, we decided to use plain English instead, to make our terms as clear as possible.\nPlease don\u0026rsquo;t forget that we are real people: take a look at our company page to get to know us a little. We are not perfect, but we\u0026rsquo;re trying our hardest, because we genuinely care about your success.\nWhen you read Balsamiq or we below, it refers to Balsamiq Studios, LLC (contact information), its affiliates (including our parent company Balsamiq SRL) and agents.\nShould you have other questions or concerns about this document, please call us at +1 (415) 367-3531 or send us an e-mail at sales@balsamiq.com.\nUsing myBalsamiq Means Accepting These Terms By accessing or using myBalsamiq in any way, whether you have created your own myBalsamiq site or are invited to someone else\u0026rsquo;s site as a project member, or are just browsing around, you agree to and are bound by the terms and conditions written in this document.\nIf you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions contained in this document, do not access myBalsamiq.\nThis Is a Living Document This is a living document. With your help, we want to make it the best in the industry.\nIf you read something that rubs you the wrong way, or if you think of something that should be added, please get in touch! We\u0026rsquo;re all ears! Email peldi@balsamiq.com and we\u0026rsquo;ll chat.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t amend this document for any particular customer, but if your changes apply to all of our customers, we\u0026rsquo;ll be happy to update it for everyone. Scroll to the bottom to see the history so far.\nWe will likely improve this document over time. By continuing to use the site, you will implicitly accept the changes we make.\nYour access and use of myBalsamiq is always subject to the most current version of this document.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to be notified every time we make a change to this document, please enter your email address below to subscribe to our \u0026ldquo;myBalsamiq ToS changes\u0026rdquo; mailing list:\nEmail:  Breach of Terms If you breach any of the terms and conditions in this document, your authorization to access or use myBalsamiq automatically terminates. Any materials downloaded or printed from myBalsamiq in violation of the Terms of Use must be immediately destroyed.\nWe may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part of myBalsamiq at any time in our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you. To this day, we have never had to do this, and we hope it never happens.\nIf you think we removed your access by mistake, get in touch and we\u0026rsquo;ll give you our reasoning. We also have a quick way to restore access without losing any of your data.\nSupport Support for myBalsamiq is provided via our Community Forums at forums.balsamiq.com as well via our support portal at support.balsamiq.com\nEmail and phone support is also included, but is only provided to myBalsamiq site owners. If you have an issue with your myBalsamiq site, contact your site owner first.\nIf you are a site owner, you can customize your myBalsamiq subdomain and upload your logo to your myBalsamiq site. As a site owner, you invite staffers and they can invite project members. You as a site owner are responsible for first-level support to the people you and your site\u0026rsquo;s staff members invite.\nWe also continuously update the myBalsamiq Documentation so that users can help themselves and site owners are better equipped to help their users.\nWe take pride in providing excellent customer support, but we are also a small team and value our work/life balance. This means that although we\u0026rsquo;ll try our best, we do not guarantee 24 / 7 support.\nAccess to Your Data What Personal Data Do You Collect and Why? We collect the following personal data:\nName\nE-mail address\nBilling Address\nIP Address\nOptional Phone number and Skype ID\nOptional Geographical location\nOptional Working hours\nWe do not collect credit card information directly. See Who can see my credit card number? below.\nThe email addresses we collect for the site owner, secondary billing administrator, and staff members are used to communicate account activity. This activity may include, but is not limited to, subscription status (renewal, cancelation, etc.), and site ownership verification. Inbound return email addresses are only used to send a reply.\nWe use cookies to identify whether you have logged in to your site. Therefore, your browser must be enabled to accept cookies from mybalsamiq.com in order for you to use myBalsamiq.\nWe collect the IP addresses of everyone who registers with myBalsamiq. This information is used for debugging and analytics purposes, and our logs are kept for 2 weeks. IP addresses and log information can be shared with the site owner upon request.\nThe Personal Data we collect is not shared with third parties, except for the purposes of determining the validity of a subscription payment. In this case we may share the name and email address of the site owner and secondary billing admin with the credit card holder, your company\u0026rsquo;s accounting department, or with Stripe when responding to a chargeback.\nWho Can See My Password? No-one. We store your password encrypted so no-one can read it. For encrypting the passwords, we use SHA512 hashing and a unique random salt for each user.\nIt is your sole responsibility to keep your user name, password and other sensitive information confidential. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security, you shall notify Balsamiq immediately.\nIf you forget your password, we send you a secure link via email that lets you reset it.\nUser management is done inside myBalsamiq, we don\u0026rsquo;t have LDAP or OAuth integration at the moment.\nBalsamiq staff will never change a password for you, nor change the site owner. Here\u0026rsquo;s an article that describes how you can change the site owner of a myBalsamiq site yourself.\nWho Can See My Credit Card Number? No-one at Balsamiq. We use the very trustworthy and secure Pin Payments and Stripe payment services. Read about their security measures on the Pin Payments Terms and Conditions and on the Stripe Security Guide (in short, they encrypt your credit card info).\nOnce you sign up Pin Payments or Stripe will charge your card each month. Pin Payments, Stripe and Balsamiq are all PCI-DSS compliant. Even though Balsamiq employees never see your credit card information, Balsamiq has an internal security policy to follow in case we accidentally come across a customer\u0026rsquo;s credit card info.\nOur Commitment to Children\u0026rsquo;s Privacy Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.\nHow Can I Access or Correct My Information? You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging in to any myBalsamiq site you have access to and visiting the settings pages.\nYou can download your projects\u0026rsquo; data at any time in a simple ZIP format containing BMML files and images.\nYou can delete your user account or site at any time. We keep your data around for at least 1 month and at the most 9 months, so that we can recover it if you deleted your site by mistake.\nIf you delete your site manually, or if your site gets suspended for payment and stays in that state for more than 1 month, we retain the right to destroy your site completely (thus \u0026ldquo;releasing\u0026rdquo; its subdomain), based on our best judgment.\nWhat Are the System Requirements for Using myBalsamiq? A modern web browser (Internet Explorer users need IE11 or higher) with cookies and javascript enabled and Adobe Flash Player version 10.2 and above is all that\u0026rsquo;s needed. Your clients have to be able to access the myBalsamiq servers, on ports 80 and 443.\nmyBalsamiq stores auto-save data and other settings in Flash Local SharedObjects on the end user\u0026rsquo;s computer. We do not clear those on exit. myBalsamiq does not use ActiveX or Java in the browser.\nWho Can See My Wireframes? It depends on the project access level you choose for your projects. By default, each project is private, but the site owner or any staff member who\u0026rsquo;s part of that project can make it public.\nFor private projects: the only people who can see your wireframes are staff members invited to the project, project members, your site owner and some balsamiq employees.\nIf you send an image permalink or a prototype view link to someone, they will be able to access that image or prototype view, even without logging in. The link is intentionally very long and hard to guess.\nFor website, blog and wiki projects: anyone with a link to your site can see your wireframes. Your public projects will also be indexed by search engines.\nWe use HTTPS and SSL (256-encryption) to transfer all data. Other than passwords, data is not encrypted when stored in our database (for performance reasons).\nUsers cannot create other users but they can invite them to the site. The site owner has the ability to get notified for any invitation and joining action, and to remove users at any time. The myBalsamiq access control matrix has all the details.\nWhat Are the Guidelines Balsamiq Follows When Accessing My Data?  We restrict who at Balsamiq can access customer data to only senior members of the team, and never to outside parties. We only do it in response to a customer support question. We only do it in order to debug and fix the issue. We never make changes to anything unless explicitly requested by a site owner. If the site owner or a site staff member asks us to look into a project in order to debug a software issue, we will go in and look at that project and possibly make minor edits in order to fix the issue. We never ever ever share what we see with other customers or the general public. We might give access to US authorities if requested in writing. We\u0026rsquo;ll try not to, but we don\u0026rsquo;t have the resources to fight the government. We\u0026rsquo;ll also keep your site owner informed as much as we can if this happens.  Who Else Has Access to My Data? We host our data on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Specifically, our database runs on RDS and other data is stored on S3. Amazon employees have access to this data. Here\u0026rsquo;s their privacy policy. Amazon controls physical access to their locations. We don\u0026rsquo;t control physical access to our locations, other than standard locked doors.\nWe use secure private keys when accessing myBalsamiq servers via SSH, and protect our AWS console passwords locally with 1Password and LastPass.\nWe log application data (username and email, subdomain and project name). We rotate logs with 14-days conservation. We stream logs from our servers to our own secure recorder server using SSL.\nAs mentioned above, we rely on Pin Payments and Stripe for payment processing.\nWe use PubNub to provide real-time updates, always sent over SSL. Here\u0026rsquo;s their privacy policy.\nHow Is My Data Protected from Another Customer\u0026rsquo;s Data? All of our customers\u0026rsquo; data resides in the same database. We use software best practices to guarantee that only people who you designate as viewers of your data can access it. In other words, we segment our customer data via software. We do our best and are very confident we\u0026rsquo;re doing a good job at it, but, like every other web app that hosts their customers data on the same database, cannot guarantee that a sophisticated hacker cannot access other people\u0026rsquo;s data.\nHow Are You Protecting My Data from Hacker Attacks? Security is one of the main reasons we chose Amazon Web Services as the infrastructure provider for myBalsamiq. It has the best track record out there, look at this article for instance.\nTo see all the steps Amazon takes to protect the data saved on its services, take a look at the extensive Security And Compliance Center and the security-related white papers. It\u0026rsquo;s what makes us sleep well at night. AWS is ISO/IEC 27002 certified.\nWe also have our own practices in place, which follow the industry\u0026rsquo;s best practices. We only give access to our servers to senior Balsamiq security experts, we keep our servers always up to date with security fixes, have one-click ways to take down servers should they become infected/compromised and to create and deploy new clean ones, we always code-review security-related code internally before checking in, have an automated suite of tests against XSS attacks, we use 2-factor authentication whenever possible, and more. We don\u0026rsquo;t run background checks on employees nor have CISSP certifications or have audit logs.\nOur myBalsamiq service has never been compromised so far.\nShould our systems get compromised, we will replace the server(s) that have been hacked with new ones (we can do this with very few clicks). If this doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop the attack, we\u0026rsquo;ll shut down the service until we can fix the vulnerability. We will also hire experts to help us and verify that we\u0026rsquo;re safe to resume service.\nWhat Should I Do If I Find a Security Vulnerability in myBalsamiq? If you have discovered a security concern, please email us at security@balsamiq.com. We’ll work with you to make sure that we understand the scope of the issue, and that we fully address your concern. We consider correspondence sent to security@balsamiq.com our highest priority, and work to address any issues that arise as quickly as possible.\nPlease act in good faith towards our users’ privacy and data during your disclosure. We won’t take legal action against you or administrative action against your account if you act accordingly: White hat researchers are always appreciated.\nCan I Run myBalsamiq on My Own Servers, behind the Firewall? Not at the moment, no. We offer other solutions (Mockups for Desktop, plugin versions) that allow you to keep your data on your servers.

The rights granted to you constitute a license and not a transfer of title. Any Balsamiq Materials made available only upon payment of a fee may only be viewed, downloaded and printed subject to your payment of such fee.  Who Owns the IP of My Wireframes and Assets? Balsamiq does not claim intellectual property rights over wireframes created on myBalsamiq nor the project and account assets your users upload.\nWe leave it to each myBalsamiq site owner to decide who should own the IP of the wireframes created using their myBalsamiq site. We encourage site owners to make their policy clear to their site users, either via email or by posting it on their myBalsamiq site.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Balsamiq has no liability of any kind should anyone you granted access to your content modify, destroy, corrupt, copy or distribute it, or violate the terms of use or other limitations that you may impose on the use of your shared content.\nBalsamiq does not pre-screen user materials that users provide or otherwise submit via myBalsamiq; however, Balsamiq may remove any posted or submitted user materials from myBalsamiq for any reason without notice in its sole discretion. By posting or submitting your user materials, you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the intellectual property rights and other rights to your user materials as described in these Terms of Use, including all the rights necessary for you to post or submit your user materials.\nIn addition, by posting or otherwise submitting your user materials that contain images, photographs, pictures, videos, webcasts or that are otherwise graphical in whole or in part (“Images”), you represent and warrant that: (a) you own the copyright in such Images, or that you have obtained all necessary license(s) from the copyright owner(s) of such Images to use such Images, or portions thereof, in keeping with your use in connection with myBalsamiq and as otherwise permitted by these Terms of Use; (b) in the event you choose to grant licenses and sublicenses to such Images, you have the rights necessary to grant the licenses and sublicenses described in these Terms of Use; and \u0026copy; you have received consent from any and all persons depicted in such Images to use the Images as set forth in these Terms of Use, including the distribution, public display, public performance and reproduction of such Images.\nYou are solely and entirely responsible for all of your user materials that you post or otherwise submit via myBalsamiq. You shall assume all risks associated with the use of your user materials including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of your user materials. Balsamiq does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of your user materials. You acknowledge and agree that by accessing or using myBalsamiq, you may be exposed to user materials from others that are offensive, indecent or otherwise objectionable.\nReliability Do You Guarantee That myBalsamiq Will Be Accessible at All Times? In short, we do not. Like all other cloud-based applications, we are vulnerable to the inherent unreliability of the Internet. We do not offer contracted SLA for availability to myBalsamiq and your data.\nThat said, high reliability is something we are proud of and something we deliberately chose to compete on. We have developers, system administrators and support staff on call, 24 / 7.\nWe monitor myBalsamiq closely and have set up automated alarms to be notified (via email and SMS) when the myBalsamiq service is under stress, so that we can deal with the issue before it becomes a problem that might impact customer access.\nYou can see for yourself how we\u0026rsquo;re doing on this front by looking at this Pingdom-powered chart (click for more info):\n\nYou acknowledge and agree that Balsamiq shall not be liable for any failure to store your materials on myBalsamiq at any time.\nHow Is Our Data Backed Up? Your wireframe images are saved on Amazon Simple Storage Service, which provides an SLA of 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability of object over a given year (link).\nYour wireframe data, site settings and projects information are saved (unencrypted other than passwords) in our database, which runs on Amazon RDS. We have a real-time backup to a slave instance in a different availability zone (for added resilience) and we keep daily database snapshots of the last 3 days. Data is replicated in 3 different data centers.\nHow Quickly Can You Recover from a Data Center Disaster? This depends on the scale of the disaster, of course.\nWe spread our app servers amongst several availability zones within the us-east-1 region, and have survived several outages in one or more zones without any downtime.\nShould the whole us-east-1 region be affected by an outage (atomic bomb over Virginia?), it would probably take us up to a week to set up everything in a new region, assuming we\u0026rsquo;d still be able to get to our backup data on S3.\nPlay Nice Clauses Use of myBalsamiq You agree that you shall not:\n Collect, harvest, mine or engage in any other activity to obtain e-mail addresses, phone numbers, personal information or any other information about others. Use or attempt to gain access to or use another’s user or company account, password, data, or computer systems or networks connected to any myBalsamiq server, whether through hacking, password mining or any other means.

Balsamiq may without restriction block, filter or delete unsolicited e-mail.\nSubdomain Squatting You may not engage in subdomain squatting. myBalsamiq sites that are inactive for more than 6 months may also be removed without further notice. Some of the factors that we take into account when determining what conduct is considered to be subdomain squatting are:\n the number myBalsamiq sites created creating myBalsamiq sites for the purpose of preventing others from using those account names creating myBalsamiq sites for the purpose of selling those accounts  Attempts to sell, buy, or solicit other forms of payment in exchange for myBalsamiq subdomains are also violations and may result in permanent account suspension.\nRestriction and Termination of Use Balsamiq may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part of myBalsamiq at any time in Balsamiq’s sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you.\nNotification of Copyright Infringement Balsamiq will, in appropriate circumstances, terminate the accounts of users who infringe the intellectual property rights of others.

Peldi 2011, Nov 2: First official draft! Removed \u0026ldquo;this is a draft\u0026rdquo; warning from the top. Peldi 2011, Nov 1: Replaced ToS link in mybalsamiq from the generic https://balsamiq.com/termsofuse and https://balsamiq.com/privacy with a link to this page, which is meant to supersede both of them with regards to myBalsamiq. Peldi 2011, Oct 30: Updated with introduction. Peldi 2011, Oct 28: Published a table-of-contents document with a \u0026ldquo;this is not ready\u0026rdquo; warning. Peldi  A note to other startups: working on a great new startup but don\u0026rsquo;t know where to start when it comes to ToS documents? Go a head and copy/paste this document, search and replace and make it yours! :) Two things though: a) make sure to have it looked over by your lawyer - you do have a lawyer right? ;) - and b) we\u0026rsquo;d appreciate a backlink, even in small gray-on-white font at the very bottom. You\u0026rsquo;ll get good karma points, which is just what new startups needs the most. :) Good luck!\n"

For example, you could create a single project for a web site design you’re working on, or you could create multiple projects for the web site design to keep parts of your design separate. How you organize is up to you.\nKeep reading to get an idea of what Staff Members can do on the home page, or watch the Projects section of the intro video on YouTube.\nAnatomy of the Home Page The screenshot below shows all the parts and functions on your site home page.\n\nView image full size in a new window \u0026rarr;\nThe home page is your main entry point for navigating projects. Whenever you want to return to this page, click the Home link in your breadcrumbs in the gray bar at the top left of the screen, or click your site name or logo in the upper left corner.\nIf you are not logged in, you will only be able to view public projects, that is, those that have access set to: Website (view project content), Blog (view project content, add comments), or Wiki (view project content, add comments, add mockups).\nIf you have no public projects and you’re not logged in, you’ll be redirected to the login page.\nYou can always sign in using the “Log in” link in the upper right corner of the screen.\nCreating Projects One of the first things you’ll do in your site is create projects to organize your mockups.\nCreating projects is simple. Click one of the these two options: the book icon that reads “New Project” in the body of the page, or the little plus icon that reads “New Project” in the upper right of the screen.\nNew Project Menus 1. New Project Icon The last book in the main area of the page is a New Project button—the big plus icon will help you spot it. You can click this to create a new project.\n2. New Project Link In the top right, below the global navigation bar is a New Project Link. You can click this to create a new project.\nNew Project Dialog Clicking on either of the New Project links will open up the new project dialog you see below.\n1. Project Name Enter a project name. You can always change it later. We tend to create a naming system, e.g. [Project Name]: [Project Sub Title], or you could use [Client Name]: [Project]. Projects are sorted alphabetically, so a nomenclature can be helpful.\n2. Mailing List Address The project name is used to create a mailing list address, which is an email alias used to notify your team of changes on the project. Project Members can also use this address to email their team from the Project Members menu.\n3. Project Description Optionally enter a project description. This can be changed later.\n4. Project Members Select project members from your list of staff and non-staff members. You can also \u0026ldquo;Automatically ass new staff members to this project\u0026rdquo; by selecting the related option.\n5. Book Cover Style Select a book cover style so that you can easily pick out projects on the home view. We find that the different book cover styles and colors help us to organize our projects. You could even use the colors to categorize project, so you can spot them quickly.\nSee also the instructions for uploading an entire project from your desktop.\nRenaming and Setting a Style On existing projects, you can easily rename and change the book cover style of a project by using the drop down menu in the bottom right.\nCloning a Project When you select “Clone…” to clone a project from the Project Menu on the home or using the Manage Project button on the project page, we create a copy of the project including all of its mockups.\nClick the Project Menu icon in the bottom right corner of the project book and select Clone…\nYou will be asked to enter the name of the new project in a dialog, and afterward you’ll be redirected to the new project page.\nUploading and Downloading Projects You can download a project to your desktop so that you have a local archive, or so you can work on your project files from Mockups for Desktop or move projects from one myBalsamiq site to another.\nUpload From a site home page, you can upload a .zip compressed file of a project folder. The project folder you\u0026rsquo;ll compress should contain all your project BMML files, and any assets (images and symbols) used by the project should be in an assets/ subdirectory.\nTo upload, simply click the Upload New Project link in the upper right of the site\u0026rsquo;s home page.\nWhen prompted by the dialog, browse for your .zip file on your computer and click Upload. Your project .zip will be uploaded in the background and will show up on the home page when the upload is complete.\nDownload Download from Home Page\nOn your site\u0026rsquo;s home page, you can download individual projects from the action menu. Click the drop down menu in the bottom right under the project title to reveal these options:\n Download BMPR: This option will create a BMPR file from your myBalsamiq project and downloads it to your computer. This file contains all the mockups and assets from this project in one file. It also includes the mockup notes, project description and alternates versions.  Note: The resulting BMPR file can be opened directly in Mockups 3 for Desktop (from version 3.5.7 and above). You can download the latest version on this page if needed.  Download Zip: This option will be saving a compressed file in .zip format. Expanding the zip file will create a directory on your computer that has all of your Mockups BMML files, and assets files used by your project.  Note: Only project assets will be included in your zip. If you used some site assets, you should download them and install them locally separately. Download from Project Pages\nFrom a project\u0026rsquo;s main page (grid, story, or list view) you can select the drop down menu next to the Edit button and select Download BMPR or Download Zip.\nArchiving a Project When you select “Archive” from the Project Menu or the using the Manage Project button on the project page, we will move the project to the site Archives.\nMoving a project to the site archives removes it from the home view, and frees up a single project from your site’s project quota. All of your contents are saved, but you will not have access to the project or its contents unless you unarchive it.\nThe archives are accessible via the \u0026ldquo;Archives\u0026rdquo; link in the upper right of your home page.\nUnarchiving a Project To unarchive a project, you must be a Staff member and have been a member of the project. While on the archives page, click the \u0026ldquo;Unarchive\u0026rdquo; link below the project title to move it to your active projects.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;ve run out of projects in your Site\u0026rsquo;s plan you will not be able to unarchive until you either free up space or upgrade your plan.\nDeleting Project When you select Delete from the Project Menu or the using the Manage Project button on the project page, we will delete the project and all of its contents permanently. This is an unrecoverable action, so be sure you download your project, using the Manage Project \u0026gt; Download Project Menu if you want to save a local copy of it first.\nNote: Contents cannot be recovered. So be sure you download it first if you’ll want to refer to it later. Site Assets The Assets link in the upper right of the home page opens the Site History manager dialog. Site Assets are images and any assets you want to share with all projects across your site.\nTo upload assets, click the Upload button in the dialog. You can upload up to 5 files at a time, each having a maximum file size of 100MB. Your computer’s upload dialog will let you select multiple files if all of your assets are in a single folder.\nFor more information, view the Assets documentation.\nSite History The single line of text under All Projects near the top left of your home page shows the last update to your site. If you click the “View History…” link, you will be taken to the Site History page, which shows an activity stream of updates for your site.\nThe site history shows the following types of activity:\n New Project Created Project Archived Project Unarchived Project Deleted New User Added New Mockup Added Mockup Updated Mockup Deleted New Comment Added to Mockup  You can learn more about the history feature, and view example history screens in the history section of the docs.\n"

    "content": " Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud was released April 4, 2016. The new version has projects, symbols, real time collaboration and lots of other improvements.\n We retired the old version of the plugin in July 2016. If you wish to use our add-on, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to start a 30 day trial and subscribe to Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud.\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t yet purchased Mockups for Confluence, but have a Cloud instance older than April 4, 2016, you will have the older plugin pre-installed. You may have even trialed this version. This older version will be removed from your Cloud instance at the end of June, so feel free to install the Mockups for 3 Confluence Cloud version, and give it a try! Here are details on how it install the connect plugin.\nIf you already purchased Mockups for Confluence in most cases we will be installing the new add-on for you as part of migrating your Balsamiq-issued license. Once your instance has been migrated to Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud, your users will just need to follow the instructions to migrate individual mockups.\nIf you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact us.\nA New File Format In the old version of Balsamiq Mockups for Confluence, we stored each mockup in its own BMML attachment, and only linked to images. Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud introduces a new project file format called BMPR: everything that belongs to a project (mockups, symbols, images, icons) is in a single file, saved as an attachment to your Confluence page. This makes it much easier to link and keep everything together. Learn more about the new plugin here.\nIn order to take advantage of the new features you need to migrate the old files to the new project format.\nInstalling Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud You can install the new plugin simply via the UPM, just search for “Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud” and click “Install” to start the 30-day trial.\nIMPORTANT: if you have the old Mockups for Confluence plugin enabled, you MUST disable it at this point, the two plugins cannot work side-by-side. Migrating Your Mockups to the New Plugin Once the new plugin is installed, when you try to edit a Balsamiq Mockups macro you will be prompted to migrate to the new version.\nClicking “Migrate to Balsamiq Mockups 3” shows this message:\nTo start the conversion process for the BMMLs on this Confluence page, just click the “Migrate to Balsamiq Mockups 3” button:\nYou will then be taken to the new version of the Balsamiq editor, where you will see a message similar to this:\nJust verify that everything is there, then select Project \u0026gt; Quit to go back to Confluence\nOnce you have returned to the Confluence editor, click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo;. You should then see the new Balsamiq Mockups 3 macro.\nThat’s it!\nYou can now take advantage of all the new Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud goodness! See the introduction here.\nBackup Copy of the v2 Wireframe and Asset Files After the migration your previous v2 wireframe and asset files will be kept as attachments. Once the migration completed successfully you can delete the files or keep them for backup.\nChanges to Licensing and Pricing Since Connect add-ons must be purchased via Atlassian Marketplace, our licensing model is changing for Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud. Purchasing is subscription-based and requires that you subscribe based on your Confluence Cloud user tier. Full pricing details are here.\nWe greatly lowered our pricing to make it more affordable to customers under this licensing model. For some customers, purchasing a subscription will be cheaper than our old pricing, and for others the prices have gone up a little due to the Marketplace matching requirement.\nHowever, for those who have a very small subset of their Confluence Users using Mockups for Confluence, we understand that even with these lower prices, because of the matching requirement, our add-on will probably not make financial sense for some teams.\nIf pricing is an issue due to the big difference between your number of mockups editors and your overall Confluence users, you may consider our web application, myBalsamiq, as a long-term solution for your team. myBalsamiq comes with unlimited users, and pricing is by active project.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t have a specific integration between Confluence and myBalsamiq, but there are ways to use the products together.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re here to help you figure out which option is best for your team! Contact us!\nCustomers with Active or Recently Expired Maintenance for Mockups for Confluence If the maintenance on your Mockups for Confluence license was current or recently expired as of June 20, 2016, we migrated your license to Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud for you (we emailed details to your billing and technical contacts on June 9, 2016).\nWe of course will be honoring the maintenance time you already purchased.\nOn June 20, 2016 Altlassian installed Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud in your Cloud instance. You\u0026rsquo;ll be given a free legacy plan in Marketplace equal the maintenance time period you purchased from Balsamiq plus an additional 6 months to make the transition to the new pricing easier (in some instances, the subscription may temporarily appear as a trial.) All of your users will have access to use Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud, even if you only paid for a subset of users to use the add-on. This $0 legacy plan will appear on your monthly or annual Marketplace bill.\nAt the end of your free legacy time, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to decide if you would like to continue to use the add-on. If you chose to continue, after your legacy plan has ended your Confluence Administrator can start the regular subscription by selecting \u0026ldquo;Free Trial.\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;ll begin with the regular 30 day trial period before the automatic renewals begin.\nIf you chose not to start a subscription, but keep the add-on installed, you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to edit or create new mockups, but you\u0026rsquo;ll still be able to view any existing mockups.\nIf pricing is the reason you could not continue after the legacy period, let us know! We may have other product options that will work for your team.\nCustomers with Expired Maintenance for Mockups for Confluence If you have not kept up the maintenance on your Mockups for Confluence license, but left the plugin enabled, you may have users who were still using Mockups for Confluence from time to time.\nIn the old version of the add-on, if you have expired maintenance you are still able to use the add-on, with a EULA violation warning, to give you time to complete your renewal.\nAs Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud is based on Marketplace\u0026rsquo;s automatic renewal subscription model, you will be required to have a paid subscription to use the add-on once your 30 day trial ends.\nWe retired the old version of the plugin in July 2016. If you wish to use our add-on, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to start a 30 day trial and subscribe to Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud.\nAs always, if you have any questions, concerns, or problems, we\u0026rsquo;re here to help!

    "content": " Mockups 3 for Jira Cloud was released January 18, 2016. The new version has projects, symbols, real time collaboration and lots of other improvements.\n We retired the old version of the plugin in June 2016. If you wish to use our add-on, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to start a 30 day trial and subscribe to Mockups 3 for Jira Cloud.\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t yet purchased Mockups for Jira, but have a Cloud instance older than January 18, 2016, you will have the older plugin pre-installed. You may have even trialed this version. This older version will be removed from your Cloud instance in May, so feel free to install the Mockups for 3 Jira Cloud version, and give it a try! Here are details on how it install the connect plugin.\nIf you already purchased Mockups for Jira in most cases we will be installing the new add-on for you as part of migrating your Balsamiq-issued license. Once your instance has been migrated to Mockups 3 for Jira Cloud, your users will just need to follow the instructions to migrate individual mockups.\nA New File Format In the old version of Balsamiq Mockups for Jira, we stored each mockup in its own BMML attachment, and only linked to images. Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Jira Cloud introduces a new project file format called BMPR: everything that belongs to a project (mockups, symbols, images, icons) is in a single file, saved as an attachment to your Jira issues. This makes it much easier to link and keep everything together. Learn more about the new plugin here.\nIn order to take advantage of the new feature you need to migrate the old files to the new project format.\nInstalling Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Jira Cloud You can install the new plugin simply via the UPM, just search for \u0026ldquo;Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Jira Cloud\u0026rdquo; and click \u0026ldquo;Install\u0026rdquo; to start the 30-day trial.\nNote: You can install the new plugin even if you still have the old version of Mockups for Jira installed and enabled, the two plugins can work side-by-side.\nWhen both plugins are enabled, you will have 2 Mockups options. Select \u0026ldquo;Add Balsamiq Mockups\u0026rdquo; to use the new plugin, Mockups 3 for Jira Cloud. The old plugin will be disabled automatically in May.\nMigrating Your Mockups to the New Plugin Once the new plugin is installed, visiting a Jira page that has BMML attachments will show this warning:\nClicking \u0026ldquo;show more details\u0026rdquo; shows this message:\nTo start the conversion process for the BMMLS on this Jira issue, just click the \u0026ldquo;to Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Jira Cloud\u0026rdquo; button\nYou will then be taken to the new version of the Mockups editor, where you will see a message similar to this:\nJust verify that everything is there, then select Project \u0026gt; Quit to go back to Jira\nYou should then see the new Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Jira Cloud panel, and two attachments: the BMPR file which contains all of your mockups and assets, and a ZIP file with the data in the old format, for backup.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it!\nYou can now take advantage of all the new Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Jira Cloud goodness! See the introduction here.\nDisabling the Old Plugin If you have the old version of the plugin installed, it will be automatically disabled for you by Atlassian during the month of May.\nThe migration instructions above will work even after the old plugin is disabled.\nChanges to Licensing and Pricing Since Connect add-ons must be purchased via Atlassian Marketplace, our licensing model is changing for Mockups 3 for Jira Cloud.

These actions are available by selecting a file and clicking one of the icons at the top of the file viewer or by right-clicking on the file. The actions available on Balsamiq Mockups files in Google Drive are common across all types of files in Google Drive, so not all of them are described here. For general help on getting around in Google Drive, check out the Google Drive Help Center.\nSharing via Google Drive Wireframes created with Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive are saved as .bmpr files that can be shared just like any other document type in Google Drive. To share your mockups select the .bmpr file and click the share button in the Google Drive file viewer (or \u0026ldquo;More \u0026gt; Share\u0026hellip; \u0026gt; Share\u0026rdquo; in the toolbar).\nIf the Google Drive users you are sharing with do not have Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive installed, they will be prompted to install it. Remember that viewing mockups with Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive is free, it\u0026rsquo;s only the saving functionality that expires after 30 days. So share away!\nNote: If you give the other person read-only permission (i.e., \u0026ldquo;Can view\u0026rdquo;) they will be able to view your mockups but not edit them. Alternatively, you can export your mockups as PNG images or an interactive PDF and use sharing in Google Drive to allow others to view them. See the Exporting Your Mockups for how to export to PNG or PDF.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve shared your mockups with another person you can both work on them at the same time. See Collaborating with Other Users in Real Time for details.\nMoving Mockups to a Different Folder Just like other Google Drive files, you can move your mockups around to various folders on your Google Drive. You may want to create one folder for all your mockups files or separate them by project.\nRename, Delete, Copy To rename, delete, or make a copy of a mockups file, select one of these options from the Google Drive actions menu (via right-click or the toolbar).\nManaging Versions You can see previous versions of your mockups via the Google Drive interface. Right-click on the .bmpr file, select \u0026ldquo;Manage Versions\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; and you will be presented with a list of old versions.\nNote: A new version is created each time you quit the application or if you manually save via the editor menu (Project \u0026gt; Save Project).

You only need one account as it can belong to as many spaces as you make, or are invited to.\nSigning Up for a Balsamiq Cloud Account The first thing you need to do to start working in Balsamiq Cloud is sign up for an account. To get started, head over to https://balsamiq.cloud.\nWe offer two sign up methods. You can complete our sign up form:\nOr you can use your Google Account to sign up and authenticate automatically.\nOnce your account is set up, you will be brought to your Spaces. If you were invited to join another space, it should be listed here, or you can create your own.\nSwitching From Google Authentication to Username + Password If you have been using Google Authentication to log into Balsamiq Cloud (or signed up with it by mistake), you can switch to a normal Username and Password setup by logging in and going to your User Settings.\nIn your User Settings, click on the Send Me an Email to Set a Password for Cloud button.\nThis will send an email to the Google email that was used for your account authentication. If you follow the link from that email, you will be able to set a new password for Cloud.\nThis new password, plus your registered email, become your new login for Cloud.\nA Note About Google Authentication When logging into Balsamiq Cloud via Google, you might notice that the sign in screen mentions Auth0, not Balsamiq cloud.\nThe (short) reason for this is because we use Auth0.com to provide authentication for our Balsamiq Cloud customers.\nThe longer reason is that authentication and login security are really hard! Rather than split our resources to handle it, we have decided to entrust Auth0 with it because authentication is the only thing that they do. They have become the industry standard when it comes to authentication libraries and they authenticate more than one billion logins a month. They have invested way more than what we could do on our own.\nWe would like Google to allow us to specify balsamiq.cloud on that dialog boss but, at the moment, that is not possible.\nIf you have any questions or concerns about this, please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to get in touch. We take security very seriously and want to make sure you feel secure in Balsamiq Cloud!\nUser Settings In the upper-right corner of the of the Spaces, Projects, and Editor views, you\u0026rsquo;ll see your user avatar (icon).\nClicking on it will give you two options: User Settings and Logout.\nThe User Settings dialog looks like this:\nYou can use it to change your name and email address, as well as reset your password.\nYou can also delete your Balsamiq Cloud account by clicking the blue button at the bottom.\n"

For example, you could create a single project for a web site design you’re working on, or you could create multiple projects for the web site design to keep parts of your design separate. How you organize is up to you.\nYou can also watch the Working with Projects section of our intro video on YouTube for a quick intro to Projects in myBalsamiq.\nAnatomy of a Project Page The image screenshot below shows all the parts and functions on a typical project page. Take a look to get an idea about what you can do on the project page.\n\nView full size image in a new window \u0026rarr;\nChanging Project Information Once you’ve created a project, it’s easy to change the project name and description from the project page.\nProject Title When you hover over a title and description from the project page you’ll notice that the text is highlighted in yellow. Any time you see this hover effect, it’s a cue that the field is editable. To edit the name or description, click the text.\nProject Description Sometimes the description for a project is shortened, and shows a More… link. You have to expand the description first, and then you’ll see the highlight effect. Click again to edit.\nYou can use the same text formatting options we provide in Mockups!\n for italic, use _this notation_ for a link, use [this notation] for bold, use *this notation* for disabled, use -this notation- for underlined, use \u0026amp;this notation\u0026amp; for color, use {color:#FF0000}this notation{color}. The #FF0000 is the color in HEX form, just like HTML. The macro will work with or without the pound sign.  Viewing Project History You may have noticed below the big project name that there’s a single line of text showing you the last update to the project, and who made it. The “View History…” text at the end of this line is a link to view the entire project history of updates.\nWe’ll keep track of every single change that was made, so you’ll always have a complete historical view of how your arrived at the solutions you’ve arrived at.\nThe project history shows these kinds of activity:\n New User Added New Mockups Added Mockup Updated Mockup Deleted Mockup Restored New Comment Added to Mockup  The project history provides a list of every change made to the project: mockups added, edited, and deleted, people added to the project, comments added, and alternate mockups promoted.\nYou can learn more about the history feature, and view example history screens in the history section of the docs.\nAdding Mockups To add a new mockup from any page in a project, click the New Mockup button in the upper right.\nYou can also upload an existing mockup from your computer by clicking the drop-down arrow next to the New Mockup button and selecting \u0026ldquo;Upload a new mockup\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nManipulating Mockups Mockup Action Menus To the right of every Mockup title is a little down arrow. That’s the drop down menu that lets you perform actions on each Mockup.\nDepending on the permissions you have, the menu provides access to features including commenting, renaming, cloning, downloading, and deleting.\nRe-Ordering Mockups Mockups can be arranged arbitrarily in whatever order makes sense for your project.\nArranging mockups in order is simple. Hover over a mockup and you’ll see a gray grip bar above the thumbnail.\nClick and hold on the bar and drag to another place on the grid to change it’s position in the order.\nNow when you use pagination and story mode, the mockup will appear in the order you’ve created on your project page.\nAdding and Managing Project Assets An assets manager is provided store re-usable images, Mockups, or other files you want to share in your project.\nTo access the Assets Manager, click the Assets link the upper right of the screen.\nTo upload assets, click the Upload button in the dialog.\nYou can upload up to 5 files at a time, each having a maximum file size of 1MB. Your computer’s upload dialog will let you select multiple files if all of your assets are in a single folder.\nFor more information, view the Assets documentation.\nAdding Project Team Members Project members have to be added to projects to be able to work on mockups and add comments.\nTo add people to projects, click the “Project Members” menu in the upper right of the screen.\nThe Project Members drop down menu will appear. You can see other members that currently have access to the project.\nClick the “Add and Manage Members” link and a pop-up will appear to add or remove staff members or submit email addresses of additional people you want to invite.\nClicking the “Save Changes and Send Invites” button will send an email invitation.\nPeople that were invited appear at the bottom of the pop-up the next time it\u0026rsquo;s opened if they haven’t accepted yet. You can click the blue arrow icon to re-send the invitation, or click the red X icon to un-invite them.\nNotes:\n You can set a staff member to automatically be added to new projects via the Staff page. You can promote non-staff members that you\u0026rsquo;ve invited to projects to staff by simply using the invite form on your Staff page. You get to the Staff page by clicking the Staff link in the header  Setting Access Control By default, all sites are set to private and only invited staff and project members will have any access.\nAccess control settings allow staff members belonging to a project to set viewing, commenting, and editing options for your projects. Only staff members may change access settings.\n1. Private (default) Only invited staff or project members may access the project. All project members have access to view mockups, add new mockups, add comment.\n2. Website Anyone may view project content (mockups and comments).\n3. Blog Anyone may view project content and add comments.\n4. Wiki (use with caution) Anyone may view project content, add comments, and add mockups.\nPlease refer to the myBalsamiq Access Control Matrix for details on \u0026ldquo;who can see and do what\u0026rdquo; based on their role.\nMockup Views  You can view your project using one of 4 main views: Grid, Story, List, and Prototype.\nYou can switch between views using the view icons. Lastly, you can use the Prototype View if you\u0026rsquo;ve linked your Mockups together, to display a click-through prototype.\n1. Grid This is the default view. It provides an overview of your project, showing a grid of your mockups as thumbnails and titles.\n2. Story The story view is a nice linear presentation of your project. All of the project’s mockups are presented with title, full mockup image, and description on a single page.\nWhen you arrange your mockups in order, this is a useful format for users who want to get an overview of the entire project, and can be useful for presentation and printing.\n3. List The list view displays your product\u0026rsquo;s mockups with smaller thumbnails. This view can be useful for managing large projects.\n4. Prototype The Prototype view allows you to show your Mockup without all of the surrounding interface of myBalsamiq. If you\u0026rsquo;ve linked your Mockups together, this can be useful as a click-through prototype, or even for doing usability testing.\nPrototype mode follows permissions settings, but allows you to share a private URL using a private key. This is useful for testing with remote usability testing services or for giving to people who aren\u0026rsquo;t project members. If you set a project to Private, anonymous users will not have access to the project\u0026rsquo;s prototype views or to browse its content, and subsequently will get an unauthorized error. However, using the shareable link with the private key in the address makes the URL shareable using an address that is not guessable.\nProject Actions From the Edit menu on the project page you can perform the following actions:\nEdit Mockups The main Edit button opens the Mockups editor so you can begin editing your Mockups.\nClone Project Creates a copy of the project and all of its mockups and project assets to a new project.\nDownload BMPR Creates a BMPR file from your myBalsamiq project and downloads it to your computer. This file contains all the mockups and assets from this project in one file. It also includes the mockup notes, project description and alternates versions.\nNote: The resulting BMPR file can be opened directly in Mockups 3 for Desktop (from version 3.5.7 and above). You can download the latest version on this page if needed. Download Zip Saves a compressed BMMLs ZIP file to your computer with all your mockups and project assets so you can easily move projects from one myBalsamiq site to another.\nExport to PDF Exports a PDF of the project. You can use the exported PDF for sharing the file with others or using as a click-through prototype.\nTo export a project, select Export PDF\u0026hellip; from the Edit Menu, and then select your export options in the dialog that appears. Click the Export PDF button to save the file to your computer.\nManage Members Allows you to add or remove project members, and invite new users by entering their email addresses. This action is only available for the project owner and for the site owner.\nChange Owner Allows you to pass the project ownership to another staff member. Again, this action is only available for the project owner and for the site owner.\nArchive Project Moves the project to the archives, where it will be inactive unless un-archived. Archived projects don\u0026rsquo;t count towards your plan. Archiving old projects allows you to create new projects without needing to upgrade your plan. You will not be able to view the project while it is archived.\nOnly the site owner and the project owner are able to archive and un-archive projects.\nDelete Project Deletes the project and all of its contents permanently.\nNote: Contents cannot be recovered. Uploading and Downloading Projects You can download a project to your desktop so that you have a local archive, or so you can work on your project files from Mockups for Desktop or move projects from one myBalsamiq site to another.\nUpload From a site home page, you can upload a .zip compressed file of a project folder. The project folder you\u0026rsquo;ll compress should contain all your project BMML files, and any assets (images and symbols) used by the project should be in an assets/ subdirectory.\nTo upload, simply click the Upload New Project link in the upper right of the site\u0026rsquo;s home page.\nWhen prompted by the dialog, browse for your .zip file on your computer and click Upload. Your project .zip will be uploaded in the background and will show up on the home page when the upload is complete.\nDownload Download from Home Page\nWhen you download a project, you\u0026rsquo;ll have two options:\n Download BMPR: This option will create a BMPR file from your myBalsamiq project and downloads it to your computer. This file contains all the mockups and assets from this project in one file. It also includes the mockup notes, project description and alternates versions.  Note: The resulting BMPR file can be opened directly in Mockups 3 for Desktop (from version 3.5.7 and above). You can download the latest version on this page if needed.  Download Zip: This option will be saving a compressed file in .zip format. Expanding the zip file will create a directory on your computer that has all of your Mockups BMML files, and assets files used by your project.  Note: Only project assets will be included in your zip. If you used some site assets, you should download them and install them locally separately. On your site\u0026rsquo;s home page you can download individual projects from the action menu. Click the drop down menu in the bottom right under the project title to reveal these options.\nDownload from Project Pages\nFrom a project\u0026rsquo;s main page (grid, story, or list view) you can select the drop down menu next to the Edit button and select Download BMPR or Download Zip. See the details for each option above.\n"

    "content": " Balsamiq Cloud is designed for collaboration and offers many ways for you to get feedback on your designs. This document outlines a few different ways so that you can pick the right one to fit each situation.\nFor sharing with collaborators, just have your Space Owner invite them as staff members. Once they’re set up as staff members on your Balsamiq Cloud Space, you can quickly invite them to projects. To learn how to work on the same wireframes together, see our article on Collaborative Editing.\nSharing with Team Members Adding someone as a project member gives them the ability to view a project and comment there, but also edit the wireframes if you give them the permission to do so.\nTo add someone as a project member, just invite them and select the desired permission.\nPublic Sharing An easy way to share a project without adding people as project members is to Allow Public Reviews from the sharing settings, as shown below\nClicking this checkbox will allow anyone to review and comment on the project, including anonymous users that you have shared the project link with.\nReviewing and Commenting The \u0026ldquo;Review and Comment\u0026rdquo; mode is a great option for anyone who does not need to edit the wireframes. Some users will only have access to this mode (see managing user permissions) but editors can switch to this mode from the top-right option in the toolbar.\nThe image below shows how to switch to this mode if you also have edit permissions.\nNotice how the border color around the profile picture translates the access level.\nThe comments panel allows you to collaborate on your designs by sharing feedback asynchronously or, if you prefer, making notes for yourself as you work. A new comment will generate a notification in the toolbar.\nCallouts You can add Callout markers to indicate specific places in the wireframe where the comments applies. See the image below to learn how.\nLinking to an Alternate Version You can also add a link to an alternate version by using the \u0026ldquo;Add Link to Alternate\u0026rdquo; drop-down at the bottom of the comments panel.\nComment Actions Once a comment is added, each reviewer can reply to it and like it. You can also edit and delete your own comments.\nFull Screen Presentation Mode The Full Screen Presentation Mode is great for sharing your wireframes with stakeholders or for usability testing. If you have created links between your wireframes, the links will be clickable.\nTo enter it, just click on the full-screen icon in the top-right corner of your toolbar, select \u0026ldquo;Full Screen Presentation\u0026rdquo; from the View menu or simply hit CTRL/CMD+F.\nThe application will expand to take up your whole screen, with your wireframe centered on it. You can learn more about this feature in Full Screen Presentation Mode.\nSharing an Interactive PDF Document PDFs generated in Balsamiq Cloud are completely interactive. That means that they not only display your project as you have designed it, they will also respect any links you have added to the project. This is one of the best ways to share your project with collaborators and clients who don\u0026rsquo;t need to make changes.\nThe PDF will be created in high resolution and with selectable text (good for the reviewers to copy/paste from). More details about exporting to PDF can be found here.\nSharing PNG Images You can export all of your wireframes to static PNG images, to easily send to clients. You can learn more about exporting to images here.\n"

This document outlines the different ways to interact with your team, while editing a project.\nNote: The following features require Edit permissions, see People and Permissions for more details. Collaborating in Real-Time Balsamiq Cloud supports real-time collaboration between users. Once two or more users join the same project, every change will be reflected in real-time with everyone. The toolbar will show users who have joined the project, and the permission level they have.\nThe navigator panel indicates which wireframes your co-workers are working on by displaying their profile picture there.\nOpening the same wireframe will allow you to see your co-worker\u0026rsquo;s edits in real-time.\nChatting with Other Editors The Editor Chat feature is a great way to discuss and gather quick feedback while working on a project. The option will appear as soon as two or more users join the same project.\nA new chat message will generate a notification in the toolbar.\nOnce clicked, the chat window will appear on the bottom-right corner of your browser window. The window can be minimized or closed using the dedicated icons on the top-right.\nCommenting and More Besides real-time collaboration and chat, Balsamiq Cloud offers many other ways to get feedback on your designs. To learn more about it, see Sharing and Reviewing.\nAmong those, the Comments Panel is a great alternative to chat, especially since it doesn\u0026rsquo;t require edit permissions.\nComments can be marked as resolved after they are reviewed and addressed. You can add Callout markers to indicate specific places in the wireframe where the comments applies or add a link to an alternate version.\nYou can learn more about comments in Reviewing and Commenting.\n"

    "content": " The image below is a marked up screenshot showing all the parts and functions on a single Mockup page.\n\nView full size image in a new window \u0026rarr;\nYou can also watch the Mockup section of our intro video on YouTube for a quick intro to Mockups in myBalsamiq.\nCreating Mockups To Create a mockup, select the New Mockup button in the upper right of a project or mockup page.\nThe New Mockup button also provides a drop down menu to create a new mockup by uploading it from your computer.\nIf you use the New Mockup button dropdown menu while on a single mockup page, the drop down menu also provides an option for cloning the mockup, which will create a copy of the mockup that you can modify.\nMockup Description, Permalink, Download Below a Mockup, you’ll see 5 bits of information:\n1. Toggle Link Hints This option allows you to turn on and off link hints. Link hints will be shown with a pink overlay so they can be seen easily.\n2. Image Permalink The image permalink below the Mockup provides a link to the Mockup image so you can embed the URL in an external web page or in emails to share the image. Note that projects must be public for the image permalink to work externally for anonymous users.\n3. Download Image The download image link opens the image (PNG format) in a new window. You can right-click the link and select Save to save to your computer.\n4. Download BMML The download BMML link provides a link to download the BMML file for the Mockup.\n5. Mockup Notes Below the Mockup links, you will find the Mockup notes. If there are no notes, the text reads “Click to edit mockup notes\u0026rdquo; if you have permission to do so. Clicking the text displays an input to add your notes, which are displayed on the single Mockup view and in the project’s story view.\nYou can use the same text formatting options we provide in Mockups!\n for italic, use _this notation_ for a link, use [this notation] for bold, use *this notation* for disabled, use -this notation- for underlined, use \u0026amp;this notation\u0026amp; for color, use {color:#FF0000}this notation{color}. The #FF0000 is the color in HEX form, just like HTML. The macro will work with or without the pound sign.  Navigating Mockups in the Project When you’re browsing through project, you can navigate easily between the Mockups two ways: Prev/Next arrows and Mockup Sidebar.\n1. Using the Previous/Next arrows If you’re viewing a single Mockup, in the top right of the screen below the project menus, you’ll see a left and right arrow. They let you navigate to the next or previous mockup in the project. Hover over one of the arrows to see the name of the next or previous Mockup, and click to go to it.\n2. The Mockup Sidebar Icon Next to the Previous/Next arrows, you’ll see a little square icon. This turns on the Mockup Sidebar.\n3. Using the Mockup Sidebar The Mockup Sidebar is a little vertical strip that slides in and out of the right side of the page to show you a list of Mockups in the project, and a thumbnail previous for each one.\nThe current Mockup is shown selected in blue. Each Mockup has a down icon to the right that opens the action menu for the Mockup. From the action menu you can view the available actions you have permission to invoke (e.g. edit, add comment, view history, rename, clone, and delete).\nAdding Comments You can add comments to Mockups, just as you would to a blog entry. This is especially important in myBalsamiq, because we use comments when reviewing different versions of Mockups. The version number shows what Mockup a comment refers to.\nScroll to the bottom of a Mockup page, enter your comment in the comment form and click the “Add Comment” button.\nYou can use the same text formatting options we provide in Mockups:\n for italic, use _this notation_ for a link, use [this notation] for bold, use *this notation* for disabled, use -this notation- for underlined, use \u0026amp;this notation\u0026amp; for color, use {color:#FF0000}this notation{color}. The #FF0000 is the color in HEX form, just like HTML. The macro will work with or without the pound sign.  Your comment will be added, and will show other project members what version of the Mockup you commented on. Users can click the version number reference to see what Mockup the comment refers to—the Mockup image will be displayed in a lightbox.\nProposing Alternate Versions Working on wireframes is an iterative process, so one of the most important aspects of the review process is proposing alternate versions.\nWe’ve made iterations a big part of the review and commenting process by allowing you to modify the current Mockup, and propose your alternate version in the comment stream.\nTo propose an alternate version, scroll down to the comment section below the Single Mockup View, and select the “Propose Alternate Version…” button. The Mockups editor will open and allow you to modify the current Mockup for your team to review.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;re done working on the alternate version in the editor (where you can add mockup notes as comments), click on \u0026ldquo;Submit Alternate Mockup and Comments\u0026rdquo;.\nAfter reviewing the alternate version proposal, users can:\n Promote the proposal as the current Mockup by clicking “Promote to Main Mockup” if they’re happy with the changes. Make further changes before promoting it by clicking “Merge into Main Mockup…”. Download the Mockup BMML  Viewing Mockup History You may have noticed below the big project name that there’s a single line of text showing you the last update to the project, and who made it. The “View History…” text at the end of this line is a link to view the entire history of updates to the project.\nWe’ll keep track of every single change that was made, so you’ll always have a complete historical view of your design decisions. Over time you’ll see how comments and alternate versions of Mockups have contribute to the unfolding story of your design.\nThe project history shows these kinds of activity:\n Mockup Updated Mockup Deleted Mockup Restored New Comment Added to Mockup  You can learn more about the history feature, and view example history screens in the history section of the docs.\nRestoring Versions We keep versions of each mockup that’s committed to your project.\nIf you’re looking at the mockup history, each earlier version will have a button to restore it as the latest Mockup. Click Restore and it’ll replace your current version.\nRestoring Deleted Mockups You can restore deleted mockups by going to the history and clicking the \u0026ldquo;Restore this version\u0026rdquo; button. You can also download the file without restoring it by clicking the \u0026ldquo;Download BMML\u0026rdquo; link. Deleted mockups may take a few minutes to appear in the history.\nYou will then see a message indicating that your mockup was restored.\nCloning Mockups The “New Mockup” button on a Mockup page has a drop-down menu with options to copy it to a new mockup using the Clone menu.\nSelect the New Mockup drop down and choose “Clone this Mockup” and we’ll copy it’s content to a new mockup and ask you to give it a title.\nMockups Editor The Mockups Editor is the application used for creating wireframes. Documentation for most aspects of the editor can be found in the myBalsamiq Mockups Editor Documentation.\n"

    "description": "",
    "content": " Note: myBalsamiq is the only version 2 web application that supports Symbols. Symbols allow you create reusable common elements across different mockups. Other software often refers to this same feature as templates, master pages, custom components, or widgets.\nCreating Symbols Symbols in Mockups are simply named groups which have been \u0026ldquo;converted\u0026rdquo; to symbols.\nSymbols can be made from existing groups, or from ones you create fresh. The following steps assume you are creating a new group.\n Select the controls you want to group Group your selection (select Edit \u0026gt;Group or CTRL/CMD+G and the group will turn a bluish color) Name the group (e.g., login form)\n Save the file with the new group (the file must be saved to convert a group to a symbol)\n Click on the \u0026ldquo;Convert To Symbol\u0026rdquo; button in the Property Inspector\n  You will notice that the group selection becomes a light green. This means that the selection is now an instance of a symbol. This new Symbol (named, for example, \u0026ldquo;login form\u0026rdquo;) will be displayed in the Project Assets tab of the UI Library. You can also add the Symbol via Quick Add.\nOverriding Symbol Properties Once you have created a symbol, you will often want to change it a little each time you use it. Imagine for instance a Symbol you created as a master page or template, containing a web page\u0026rsquo;s title and navigation.\nAll your website pages will have the same font size and position for the title, but the title\u0026rsquo;s text should be different on each page. Same goes for which page should be shown as current in your navigation bar.\nSymbols allow you to achieve this result by letting you override symbol properties each time you use a symbol. To do so, start by double-clicking (or hitting ENTER) on a symbol to \u0026ldquo;enter it\u0026rdquo;.\nAlthough this experience is very similar to editing a group\u0026rsquo;s contents, you will notice that Mockups warns you that what you\u0026rsquo;re doing is really overriding some properties of a Symbol.\nAt this point, you can manipulate each control inside the symbols at will, as if you were editing a group. Some operations are not permitted while overriding symbol properties, such as adding, deleting or grouping controls.\nIf you make a mistake, you can always undo to get back. If you want to remove a single property change and go back to a Symbol\u0026rsquo;s default property, you can click on the little green \u0026ldquo;x\u0026rdquo; icon in the Property Inspector.\nYou can also revert all changes you made to a Symbol\u0026rsquo;s instance at once, via the \u0026ldquo;x\u0026rdquo; icon in the Property Inspector you see when selecting the whole symbol.\nEditing a Symbol\u0026rsquo;s Source The main benefit of reusable Symbols is that if you need to make a change, you can just do it in one place and it will be propagated to all the instances (uses) of that Symbol.\nTo edit a Symbol\u0026rsquo;s source, you need only open the Symbol Library and edit it normally, just as you would edit a group.\nSave your changes, go back to a mockup that uses that symbol and notice that your changes have been applied, just like that!\nThere are a couple of shortcuts in the app that help you reach a Symbol\u0026rsquo;s source in order to edit it:\n You can select a Symbol instance and hit the \u0026ldquo;Edit Source\u0026rdquo; button in the property inspector.\n You can enter a Symbol for overriding, then hit the \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026rdquo; button there.\n  Symbol Libraries A Symbol Library is a collection of symbol definitions. You might want to create a Symbol Library in order to share common controls with your team.\nTo create a Symbol Library, you can either create a symbol (which will automatically create a library) or select Project \u0026gt; New Symbol Library from the menu.\nSharing Symbols across Projects If you would like a Symbol Library to be used across all projects, you only need to upload the library to your site assets.\nTo do this, you first have to download the library from your project assets.\nThis will download a .bmml file to your computer. Take that .bmml file and upload it to your site assets.\nDoing this will allow that Symbol Library to be accessed across all your projects!\n"

You can use this as a place to store re-usable images, Mockups, or other files you want to share with your team.\nTo access the Assets Manager, click the Assets link in the top right of the page. The screenshot below shows what to look for.\n1. Site Assets Site Assets are files which will be available for use across all of your projects. You can access the Site Assets manager from the home page. If you access the Assets Manager from projects pages, you will see both a Project Assets and Site Assets tab in the assets manager dialog.\n2. Project Assets Project Assets are files which are available only to mockups within a single project. You can access the Project Assets manager from the main Project page in grid, story, and map views, or from a single Mockup view. When you open the Assets Manager from any of these views, you will notice that you will see that project’s assets in the Project Assets tab, but can also see the site assets in the Site Assets tab.\nThe Assets Manager dialog is show below. This screenshot was opened from a project, so it is showing both Site Assets and Project Assets.\nAssets in the Mockups Editor Using Assets: in the mockup editor you will find your images and symbols in the Project Assets and Site Assets tabs of the UI Library. Just double-click or drag-and-drop your selected asset to the canvas to use it. Mockups supports GIF, JPG/JPEG, and PNG image file formats.\nUploading Images: add an image control and double-click on it to open the image upload dialog.\nSelect the Project Asset or Site Asset tab depending on where you\u0026rsquo;d like the image to be saved, then click Browse\u0026hellip;, choose your image file and click Attach to upload the image to the server.\nSymbols For creating and editing Symbol libraries, please refer to the Using Symbols in myBalsamiq document.\n"

On the left is the Mockup Navigator, which allows you to switch between mockups manually. On the right is the options panel.\nThe Options Panel Most of the time, the option panel will have 3 buttons:\n Toggle Link Highlights: The left-most button in the options panel allows you to show and hide linking highlights on your mockups. Because the Prototype View is completely interactive, any links that you have added to your mockups will work in this view as well. Edit This Mockup: The middle button in the options panel allows you to quickly jump into the myBalsamiq editor and edit the current mockup. This option will only be available to members of the project - the button is hidden for anyone who is not on the project.

Select all the controls from this wireframe (CTRL/CMD+A) and copy the controls (CTRL/CMD+C) In the target project, paste your controls (CTRL/CMD+V) in a newly created wireframe  That’s it! You may now delete the wireframe from the source project if you wish.\nNote: Symbols and images won’t get transferred in this process. You will have to manually add them to the target project. Alternatively, you can also use the JSON feature, available in the Export menu:\n Open the two projects In the source project, select the wireframe you want to copy or move. In the Project menu, select Export \u0026gt; Wireframe to JSON\u0026hellip; This will put a text-based representation of the wireframe in the clipboard. In the target project, select Import \u0026gt; Wireframe JSON\u0026hellip; from the Project menu. In the dialog that pops up, paste the content of the clipboard with CTRL/CMD+V and click the Import button.  Importing from Other Versions of Balsamiq If you have a project created in another Balsamiq product (using the .bmpr extension), you can directly upload your project to your Balsamiq Cloud Space, as detailed here.\nAnother easy way to import it is to create a new project and use the \u0026ldquo;Project \u0026gt; Import \u0026gt; Import from BMPR..\u0026rdquo; option.\nImporting from myBalsamiq If you are using myBalsamiq and would like to move your wireframes to Balsamiq Cloud, here is the way to download a project from your myBalsamiq project page:\nThe option is also available from your myBalsamiq home page:\nThe “Download BMPR” option will create a BMPR file from your myBalsamiq project and downloads it to your computer.

    "content": " Since myBalsamiq is all about collaboration, we offer many ways for you to get feedback on your designs.\nThis document outlines a few different ways, so that you can pick the right one to fit each situation.\nFor sharing with colleagues: just have your site owner invite them as staff members. Once they\u0026rsquo;re set up as staff members on your myBalsamiq site you can quickly add them to projects via the Project Members menu.\nMake Them a Project Member This is what we expect people will use the most.\nAdding someone as a project member gives them the ability to comment on your mockups, get notified of mockup changes and really follow and participate in the project\u0026rsquo;s progress (learn more).\nProject members also have the ability to edit mockups, but don\u0026rsquo;t worry about losing anything accidentally, every version is stored in the project history and can be recovered easily.\nTo add someone as a project member, just invite them via the Project Members menu.\nSend Them a Prototype View Link If you want to keep your project private but don\u0026rsquo;t want to force your customers to create a myBalsamiq login, and if your mockups are linked together, you could use the Prototype View feature.\nJust launch the prototype view, copy the long and nearly-impossible-to-guess URL (it makes it secure) and send it to them. They will be able to see it and click around without having to log in.\nNote: Once the URL is shared, it will be accessible to whomever has it. The only way to deactivate the link is to archive or delete the project. Send Them Individual Mockup Image Permalinks Similar to the approach above, you could simply send them single mockup images using the Image Permalink feature.\nThis link doesn\u0026rsquo;t require people to log in (but is secure due to it\u0026rsquo;s crazy-long and hard to guess), and will always return the latest version of a mockup\u0026rsquo;s image.\nThis makes it possible to share mockups that are not linked together or even to embed them in other tools that let you insert images (a simple web page you\u0026rsquo;re putting together or even a usability testing tool).\nNote: People you share this URL with will NOT be able to add comments within myBalsamiq this way, and once the URL is shared, it will be accessible to whomever has it. Make Your Project Public If you are not concerned with keeping the work secret, this is a very quick way to allow external stakeholders to review, comment or even edit your wireframes.\nJust set the project\u0026rsquo;s access control slider to your favorite level of public sharing (website, blog or wiki), and send your clients a link to the project. If you set it to blog or wiki, they will be able to comment without creating a login.\nExport the Project to PDF Yet another option is to use the \u0026ldquo;Export to PDF\u0026rdquo; feature (available from the Project Page) to export the entire project as a PDF. Just format the PDF the way you prefer, download it and send it to them for review.\nThey will be able to click links and write annotations to the PDF directly (if they know how in their PDF reader).\nSome tips about exporting to PDF:\n To get consistently sized screens Consider using a background control (rectangle/container or browser) at the same dimensions on every page. Add it beneath all of the controls in your Mockup and lock it for best results. To export at actual size (100%) Select the \u0026ldquo;Optimize for Viewing\u0026rdquo; radio button in the Export dialog. To get Acrobat Reader to show single page prototypes Select the menu: Edit -\u0026gt; Preferences; Select: Full Screen -\u0026gt; Full Screen Navigation; Un-tick the \u0026ldquo;Left click to go forward one page\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;  Print the Story View as PDF If you are looking for a more traditional \u0026ldquo;spec\u0026rdquo;, what you could do is go to the project page, select the \u0026ldquo;Story\u0026rdquo; view and print that page to PDF. It puts all the mockups and their notes one on top of the other in a nice spec-like format.\nDownload the Project and Send Them the BMPR File If your clients use one of our Mockups 3 product, you could download the whole project as a BMPR file and email it to them. They will be able to play around with the resulting BMPR file in any Mockups 3 product (from version 3.5.7) and above. Each product comes with a 30-days free trial and if the trial expires, the product can still be used to view the project.\nWe hope this document gave you some ideas on how to share with others using myBalsamiq. If you have any questions, let us know!\n"

    "uri": "https://mmclssg1.github.io/ssdocs/_editor/_b3/symbols/",
    "title": "Working with Symbols",
    "tags": [],
    "description": "",
    "content": " Balsamiq Mockups supports the concept of Symbols. A Symbol is a group of controls that represents a single piece of functionality. It is often used for parts of the user interface that show up on several screens. Other software sometimes refers to this feature as templates, master pages, custom components, or widgets.\nIn essence, Symbols let you create reusable common elements that you can use across different mockups.\nCreating Symbols There are two ways to create a Symbol, described below.\n1. Creating Symbols in the Mockups View Creating a Symbol in the Mockups view starts with grouping the set of controls that you want to become your Symbol. You can create a new group or use a group you already have. The following steps assume you are creating a new group.\n Select the controls you want to group.\n Group your selection (select Edit \u0026gt;Group, click the Group icon in the toolbar, or use CTRL/CMD+G). Note that the controls will turn a bluish color to indicate they are a group.\n Name the group.\n Click on the \u0026ldquo;Convert To Symbol\u0026rdquo; button in the Property Inspector\n  You will notice that the group selection becomes a light green. This means that the selection is now an instance of a Symbol and you can reuse it in your project.\nThis new Symbol will be displayed in the Symbols category of the UI Library for all mockups in your project so that you can easily add it to any mockup.\nTip: Once a Symbol has been created you can also add it via Quick Add using the first few letters of its name, just like other controls. The video below describes the process of creating, editing, and using Symbols.\n 2. Using the Symbols View New in Balsamiq Mockups 3 is a dedicated view for creating and managing Symbols. Symbols created using the Mockups view will be shown here, and you can also create Symbols in this view.\nTo get to the Symbols view, use the navigator icon and select Symbols. You will see any existing Symbols in a list in the left panel.\nThe toolbar contains two icons for creating Symbols: one for creating one from a blank canvas and another for importing.\nClick the New Symbol Library icon to create a new Symbol Library. The Symbols view shows Symbols as well as their Symbol Library containers. In Symbols view it is helpful to know the difference before creating them. Read on for an explanation.\nSymbols vs. Symbol Libraries A Symbol Library is a collection of individual Symbols. It can be used as a way of grouping Symbols with similar purposes. Symbol Libraries are useful for managing and organizing Symbols if you have a lot of them. If you aren\u0026rsquo;t a heavy user of Symbols you can keep them all in one Symbol Library (you can always add more Symbol Libraries later).\nIn Symbols view Symbols are shown as a nested list inside their Symbol Library, as shown below.\nYou can select the Symbol Library name to see all the Symbols it contains, or you can select the name of an individual Symbol to see only that Symbol.\nWhen viewing a Symbol you will see a small floating bar showing a breadcrumb path to the Symbol Library. If you have groups within your Symbol the breadcrumb bar will help you navigate back out of the groups.\nThe icon at the top of the list of Symbols allows you to choose whether you want to see other Symbols in the Symbol Library along with the selected Symbol or not.\nNote: The Symbol Library that a Symbol belongs to is ignored in the UI Library and Quick Add. You will see a list of all your Symbols, regardless of which Symbol Library they belong to. Creating Symbols in the Symbols View Creating Symbols in Symbols view is similar to creating Symbols in Mockups view, except that you don\u0026rsquo;t need to group them. Any controls you add to the Symbol become part of it immediately.\nAs described above you can add a new Symbol to an existing Symbol Library or inside a new one. To create a new Symbol, click the \u0026lsquo;+\u0026rsquo; icon to the right of a Symbol Library. This will create a new Symbol inside that Symbol Library (called \u0026ldquo;New Symbol\u0026rdquo;, for example).\nWhen you create a new Symbol Library two sample Symbols are created automatically to help you learn about how Symbols work. Feel free to modify or delete them.\nNote: You can add controls to the Symbol Library itself, but these controls will not be shown when the Symbols are used in your mockups. Adding controls such as sticky notes to your Symbol Libraries can be useful for making notes about them that don\u0026rsquo;t need to be shown in the UI. Importing Symbols In addition to creating Symbols from scratch, you can import Symbols created in a previous version of Balsamiq Mockups. Click the Import Symbol Library button to open a dialog for importing Mockups files in BMML format.\nYou can also import Symbols from the Project \u0026gt; Import menu.\nThe imported Symbol will be created in a new Symbol Library.\nUsing Symbols in Your Mockups You can use Symbols just like any other control in Mockups. You can add them from the UI Library or Quick Add and move and arrange them with other controls in your mockups.\nThe primary difference is that the properties for the Symbol itself are limited, similar to other grouped controls.\nThe big advantage is, of course, that any changes you make to your Symbols will update everywhere you use them. Read on to learn about editing Symbols.\nEditing Symbols When you select a Symbol on the Mockups canvas you\u0026rsquo;ll see two Symbol properties in the Property Inspector: Break Apart and Edit Source.\n\u0026ldquo;Break Apart\u0026rdquo; breaks the connection between the individual controls inside the Symbol and the Symbol itself for the selected instance, meaning that it is no longer a Symbol (although the original Symbol remains intact). Any changes you make to a broken apart Symbol will not get updated elsewhere and any changes made to the Symbol will not update where it has been broken apart.\n\u0026ldquo;Edit Source\u0026rdquo; does what you\u0026rsquo;d expect it to do, it takes you to the Symbols view where you can edit the Symbol. The main benefit of reusable Symbols is that if you need to make a change, you can just do it in one place and it will be propagated to all the instances (uses) of that Symbol. When you are done editing a Symbol you can click the \u0026ldquo;Back to Mockups\u0026rdquo; button on the canvas. Edits made to the Symbol will be immediately reflected in any mockups that it is used in.\nTip: You can also edit a Symbol by right-clicking on it in the UI Library and selecting \u0026ldquo;Edit Symbol Source.\u0026rdquo; Overriding Symbol Properties Once you have created a Symbol, you might want to change it a little each time you use it. Imagine for instance a Symbol you created as a master page or template, containing a web page\u0026rsquo;s title and navigation.\nAll your website pages will have the same font size and position for the title, but the title\u0026rsquo;s text should be different on each page. The same goes for which page should be shown as selected in your navigation bar.\nSymbols allow you to achieve this result by letting you override certain Symbol properties each time you use a Symbol. To do so, start by double-clicking on a symbol to \u0026ldquo;enter it\u0026rdquo;. Although this experience is very similar to editing a group\u0026rsquo;s contents, you will notice that Mockups 3 informs you that what you\u0026rsquo;re doing is really overriding some properties of a Symbol.\nAt this point, you can manipulate each control inside the symbols at will, as if you were editing a group. Some operations are not permitted while overriding symbol properties, such as adding, deleting or grouping controls. If, instead, you want to edit all instances of the Symbol click the \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026rdquo; button.\nIf you make a mistake, you can always undo to get back. If you want to remove a single property change and go back to a Symbol\u0026rsquo;s default property, you can click on the little green \u0026ldquo;x\u0026rdquo; icon in the Property Inspector.\nYou can also revert all changes you made to a Symbol\u0026rsquo;s instance at once, via the \u0026ldquo;x\u0026rdquo; icon in the Property Inspector you see when selecting the whole symbol.\nUsing Symbols across Projects If you want to use the same Symbol in multiple projects, you can copy it to another project by dragging it from one project to another. You can also create a template project, described in Using Symbols and Assets across Projects.\nManaging Symbols In addition to creating Symbols and Symbol Libraries in Symbols view, it is also a good place to manage and organize your Symbols.\nYou can add notes to both your Symbols and Symbol Libraries in the Properties panel on the right. When an individual Symbol is selected the lower portion of the panel shows which mockups (if any) the Symbol is used in. This can be used to see if you can delete any Symbols that aren\u0026rsquo;t being used, for example. Clicking on a mockup name will take you to that mockup in the Mockups view. Renaming Symbols To rename either a Symbol or Symbol Library you can double-click its name in the navigator panel on the left or use the context menu.\nDeleting Symbols You can also use the context menu to delete Symbols and Symbol Libraries from your project. In the case of Symbol Libraries, like with mockups and images, deleting will move them to the trash, where you can delete them permanently or restore them. Deleting an individual Symbol from a Symbol Library, however, deletes it permanently.\nTip: You can hold down Shift or Control/CMD to select multiple Symbols and delete or move multiple Symbols at once. Just like with images, deleting a Symbol from a mockup does not delete the Symbol, only that instance of the Symbol.\nCloning Symbols Cloning Symbols (also available via the context menu) can save you time when creating Symbols or Symbol Libraries that are similar.\nMoving Symbols You can move individual Symbols from one Symbol Library to another by dragging them around in the Symbols view. You can also copy Symbols from one project to another as described above.\n"

This is useful for testing with remote usability testing services or for giving to people who aren\u0026rsquo;t project members. If you set a project to Private, anonymous users will not have access to the project\u0026rsquo;s prototype views or to browse its content, and subsequently will get an unauthorized error. However, using the shareable link with the private key in the address makes the URL shareable using an address that is not guessable.\nHere are a couple of articles on how to integrate myBalsamiq\u0026rsquo;s prototype view with the leading user testing tools:\n User Testing Your Balsamiq Mockups with CanvasFlip User Testing your Balsamiq Prototypes with TryMyUI User Testing Your Mobile Balsamiq Mockups with HeatData User Testing your myBalsamiq prototypes with UserTesting.com How to test your myBalsamiq prototypes with Loop11 User Testing your myBalsamiq wireframes with Usabilla User Testing your myBalsamiq Prototypes with Kupima User Testing your myBalsamiq Prototypes with UserZoom Give Mockup presentations on your iPad/iPhone with Link Viewer  The same approach can be used with any user-testing tool that supports entering URLs in their tests.

This ensures that you will never lose any work.\nMockups 3 for Desktop automatically saves in two places. First, it commits all changes in real time to the internal backup file. Then after a short period of inactivity, Mockups 3 for Desktop will commit the changes to your original project file. This delay should help when you\u0026rsquo;re saving to a networked drive or folder.\nDisabling Autosave If you find that the autosave feature is causing you problems or your workflow is better suited by manually saving, this is how you would disable it.\nIn the Project drop down menu, you will find an item named Auto Save Every Change. If that menu item has a check mark next to it, that means autosave is enabled. Clicking on it will disable autosave.\nWhile autosave is disabled, your changes will only be committed to your original project file when you manually save them, either via the Project \u0026gt; Save menu option, or by using the keyboard shortcut (CMD+S on OS X and CTRL+S on Windows).\nYour changes are still being saved to the internal backup file, and they will automatically recover if you close Mockups without remembering to save.\nIn the event you want to discard any changes you have made to the file, you can use the Project \u0026gt; Reload from Disk\u0026hellip; menu item to revert to the last thing you saved to your original project file.\nRe-Enabling Autosave To re-enable Mockups 3 for Desktop\u0026rsquo;s autosave feature, simply click the Project \u0026gt; Auto Save Every Change menu item.

You can access it by opening a Finder window, clicking on the \u0026ldquo;Go\u0026rdquo; menu option at the top of your screen, and then pressing the \u0026ldquo;alt/option\u0026rdquo; key on your keyboard. That will make the Library folder selectable in the dropdown menu. Unhiding System Files in Windows In Windows 7, if you don\u0026rsquo;t see Documents and Settings, you may need to \u0026ldquo;unhide system files.\u0026rdquo; Here are the steps to do that:\n Open Windows Explorer (Start+E) Select the menu item \u0026ldquo;Organize \u0026gt; Folder and search options.\u0026rdquo; Select the View tab, and uncheck \u0026ldquo;Hide protected operating system files.\u0026rdquo;  Documents and Settings should show up under C:\\ in your Windows Explorer now. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t, you may need to restart.\nMockups 3 for Desktop backs up any file you open to a local folder. These local versions are stored for (around) seven days and should automatically load in case of a corrupted project file.\nVersions of Mockups 3 for Desktop prior to 3.4 do not have the automatic recovery feature. This FAQ will show you how to recover the file manually.\nBackups Backups are stored in the Local Storage folder in two folders.\n The LocalProjects Folder: The LocalProjects folder is for projects that you have saved at least once. We keep projects in this folder for about a week before deleting them.\n The UnsavedProjects Folder: The UnsavedProjects folder is for projects that you haven\u0026rsquo;t had a chance to save yet, but have been working on. Check here if you re-opened Mockups 3 for Desktop, but your new project didn\u0026rsquo;t open up with it.\n  Restoring Backups Check both the LocalProjects and UnsavedProjects folders for your project. You may have to open a couple of different projects to find a working or up-to-date version. Once you have found and opened it, Select Project \u0026gt; Save As and save the file in a new location. Saving it allows both the backup and a new version of the file to exist, which keeps your data safe!\nNote: We do not recommend moving files out of the Local Store folder. If you want to move a backed up file to another folder, we recommend copying the file (CTRL/CMD+C), and then pasting it to the destination (CTRL/CMD+V). "

    "content": " Collaboration is the foundation of Mockups. From working with your clients and customers, to collaborating with your designers and programmers, Mockups was built with collaboration at its core. Here are the ways you can share your projects.\nShare Mockups Project Files A great way to share your work is to send your Mockups project files (files with a .bmpr extension) directly to your clients and collaborators. Just be sure to include a link to download Balsamiq Mockups - https://balsamiq.com/download - if they don\u0026rsquo;t already have it.\nTell your clients to install Balsamiq Mockups and open the file(s) you sent. They will be able to go full-screen and click around or view the mockups in the editor. During the 30 day trial period they’ll be able to make changes and save them.\nWhen the trial expires, they won’t be able to edit but they’ll still be able to view them, click the links, and even copy the text strings if needed.\nShare an Interactive PDF Document PDFs generated by Mockups are completely interactive. That means that they not only display your project as you have designed it, they will also respect any links you have added to the project as well. This is one of the best ways to share your project with collaborators and clients who don\u0026rsquo;t need to make changes.\nNote: PDFs with links also work great on mobile phones and tablets! Share PNG Images You can export all of your mockups to static PNG images, and send those to your clients. More info about that feature here.\nUse Balsamiq Cloud Balsamiq Cloud is our web-based wireframing solution designed for large teams. With Balsamiq Cloud, you can invite your collaborators to view, interact with, and even edit your project. Your existing projects are completely compatible with Balsamiq Cloud, all you need to do is upload them. Check it out today and see how to share your work with outside clients in Balsamiq Cloud..\nReal-Time Collaboration Real-time collaboration is available now in six of our apps:\n Balsamiq Cloud Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive Balsamiq Wireframes for Confluence Server Balsamiq Wireframes for Jira Server Balsamiq Wireframes for Confluence Cloud Balsamiq Wireframes for Jira Cloud.  We are currently working on bringing real-time collaboration to our new desktop applications. Stay tuned\u0026hellip;\n"

    "tags": [],
    "description": "",
    "content": " Please read this document carefully before accessing or using Balsamiq Cloud.\nIntroduction English, Not Legalese Most Terms of Use and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable. They are written by lawyers and for lawyers, and in our opinion are not very effective.\nBecause we believe in establishing long-term relationships with our customers, we decided to use plain English instead as much as possible, to make our terms as clear as possible.\nPlease don\u0026rsquo;t forget that we are real people: take a look at our company page to get to know us a little. We are not perfect, but we\u0026rsquo;re trying our hardest, because we genuinely care about your success.\nWhen you read Balsamiq or we below, it refers to Balsamiq Studios, LLC (contact information), its affiliates (including our parent company Balsamiq SRL) and agents.\nShould you have other questions or concerns about this document, please call us at +1 (415) 367-3531 or send us an e-mail at sales@balsamiq.com.\nUsing Balsamiq Cloud Means Accepting These Terms By accessing or using Balsamiq Cloud (https://balsamiq.cloud) in any way, whether you have created your own Balsamiq Cloud Space or are invited to someone else\u0026rsquo;s Space as a project member, or are just browsing around, you agree to and are bound by the terms and conditions written in this document.\nIf you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions contained in this document, do not access Balsamiq Cloud.\nThis Is a Living Document This is a living document. With your help, we want to make it the best in the industry.\nIf you read something that rubs you the wrong way, or if you think of something that should be added, please get in touch! We\u0026rsquo;re all ears! Email peldi@balsamiq.com and we\u0026rsquo;ll chat.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t amend this document for any particular customer, but if your changes apply to all of our customers, we\u0026rsquo;ll be happy to update it for everyone. Scroll to the bottom to see the history so far.\nWe will likely improve this document over time. By continuing to use the site, you will implicitly accept the changes we make.\nYour access and use of Balsamiq Cloud is always subject to the most current version of this document.\nBreach of Terms If you breach any of the terms and conditions in this document, your authorization to access or use Balsamiq Cloud automatically terminates. Any materials downloaded or printed from Balsamiq Cloud in violation of the Terms of Use must be immediately destroyed.\nWe may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part of Balsamiq Cloud at any time in our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you. To this day, we have never had to do this, and we hope it never happens.\nIf you think we removed your access by mistake, get in touch and we\u0026rsquo;ll give you our reasoning.\nSupport Support for Balsamiq Cloud is provided via our Community Forums at forums.balsamiq.com as well via our support portal at support.balsamiq.com\nEmail and phone support is also included, but is only provided to Balsamiq Cloud Space Owners. If you have an issue with your Balsamiq Cloud Space, contact your Space Owner(s) first, via their email address (shown in Balsamiq Cloud).\nSpace Owners can invite staffers and they can invite project members. Space Owners are responsible for first-level support to the people on their Balsamiq Cloud Spaces.\nWe continuously update the Balsamiq Cloud Documentation so that users can help themselves and Space Owners are better equipped to help their users.\nWe take pride in providing excellent customer support, but we are also a small team and value our work/life balance. This means that although we\u0026rsquo;ll try our best, we do not guarantee 24 / 7 support.\nAccess to Your Data / Privacy Policy What Personal Data Do You Collect and Why? We collect the following personal data:\nName\nE-mail address\nBilling Address\nIP Address\nWe do not collect credit card information directly. See Who can see my credit card number? below.\nThe email addresses we collect for the Space Owners, Billing-Only Administrator, and staff members are used to communicate account activity. This activity may include, but is not limited to, subscription status (renewal, cancelation, etc.), and Space Ownership verification. Inbound return email addresses are only used to send a reply.\nWe use cookies to identify whether you have logged in to your Space. Therefore, your browser must be enabled to accept cookies from balsamiq.cloud in order for you to use Balsamiq Cloud.\nWe collect the IP addresses of everyone who registers with Balsamiq Cloud. This information is used for debugging and analytics purposes, and our logs are kept for 2 weeks. IP addresses and log information can be shared with Space Owners upon request.\nThe Personal Data we collect is not shared with third parties, except for the purposes of determining the validity of a subscription payment. In this case we may share the name and email address of the Space Owner(s) and Billing-Only Admin with the credit card holder, your company’s accounting department, or with Stripe when responding to a chargeback.\nWho Can See My Password? No-one. We use Auth0 for authentication. They\u0026rsquo;re the industry leader, and that\u0026rsquo;s all they do. They can store your password much more safely than we can. Learn more about Auth0 security here: Auth0 Security \u0026amp; Privacy.\nIt is your sole responsibility to keep your user name, password and other sensitive information confidential. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security, you must notify Balsamiq immediately.\nIf you forget your password, we send you a secure link via email that lets you reset it.\nUser management is done inside Balsamiq Cloud. We have Google integration, but no LDAP or OAuth at the moment.\nBalsamiq staff will never change a password for you, nor change the Space Owner. Here\u0026rsquo;s an article that describes how you can change the Space Owner of a Balsamiq Cloud Space yourself.\nWho Can See My Credit Card Number? No-one at Balsamiq. We use the very trustworthy and secure Stripe payment service. Read about their security measures on the Stripe Security Guide (in short, they encrypt your credit card info).\nOnce you sign up Stripe will charge your card each month. Both Stripe and Balsamiq are PCI-DSS compliant. Even though Balsamiq employees never see your credit card information, Balsamiq has an internal security policy to follow in case we accidentally come across a customer\u0026rsquo;s credit card info.\nOur Commitment to Children\u0026rsquo;s Privacy Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.\nHow Can I Access or Correct My Information? You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging in to any Balsamiq Cloud Space you have access to and visiting the Space Settings page, or by the User Settings dialog.\nYou can download your projects\u0026rsquo; data at any time in BMPR format.\nYou can delete your projects, Spaces or user account at any time, and they will be destroyed from our database immediately, with no way for us to recover them.\nWhat Are the System Requirements for Using Balsamiq Cloud? A modern web browser (IE11 or Edge, Chrome 49+, Firefox 52+, Safari 9+) with cookies and javascript enabled is all that\u0026rsquo;s needed.\nYour clients have to be able to access the Balsamiq Cloud servers on port 443.\nWho Can See My Wireframes? The people you share them with, as described in the People and Permissions documentation, as well as the Space Owner(s) and some balsamiq employees.\nWe use HTTPS and SSL (256-encryption) to transfer all data. Data is not encrypted when stored in our database (for performance reasons).\nWhat Are the Guidelines Balsamiq Follows When Accessing My Data?  We restrict who at Balsamiq can access customer data to only senior members of the team, and never to outside parties. We only do it in response to a customer support question. We only do it in order to debug and fix the issue. We never make changes to anything unless explicitly requested by a Space Owner. If a Space Owner or a staff member asks us to look into a project in order to debug a software issue, we will go in and look at that project and possibly make minor edits in order to fix the issue. We never share what we see with other customers or the general public. We might give access to US authorities if requested in writing. We\u0026rsquo;ll try not to, but we don\u0026rsquo;t have the resources to fight the government. We\u0026rsquo;ll also keep your Space Owner(s) informed as much as we can if this happens.  Who Else Has Access to My Data? We host our data on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Specifically, our database runs on RDS. Amazon employees have access to this data. Here\u0026rsquo;s their privacy policy. Amazon controls physical access to their locations. We don\u0026rsquo;t control physical access to our locations, other than standard locked doors.\nWe use secure private keys when accessing Balsamiq Cloud servers via SSH, and protect our AWS console passwords locally with 1Password and LastPass.\nWe log application data (username, user IP, email and project name). We rotate logs with 14-days conservation. We stream logs from our servers to Logmatic.io using SSL. Here\u0026rsquo;s their privacy policy.\nAs mentioned above, we rely on Stripe for payment processing.\nWe use PubNub to provide real-time updates, always sent over SSL. Here\u0026rsquo;s their privacy policy.\nHow Is My Data Protected from Another Customer\u0026rsquo;s Data? All of our customers\u0026rsquo; data resides in the same database. We use software best practices to guarantee that only people who you designate as viewers of your data can access it. In other words, we segment our customer data via software. We do our best and are very confident we\u0026rsquo;re doing a good job at it, but, like every other web app that hosts their customers data on the same database, cannot guarantee that a sophisticated hacker cannot access other people\u0026rsquo;s data.\nHow Are You Protecting My Data from Hacker Attacks? Security is one of the main reasons we chose Amazon Web Services as the infrastructure provider for Balsamiq Cloud. It has the best track record out there, look at this article for instance.\nTo see all the steps Amazon takes to protect the data saved on its services, take a look at the extensive Security And Compliance Center and the security-related white papers. It\u0026rsquo;s what makes us sleep well at night. AWS is ISO/IEC 27002 certified.\nWe also have our own practices in place, which follow the industry\u0026rsquo;s best practices. We only give access to our servers to senior Balsamiq security experts, we keep our servers always up to date with security fixes, have one-click ways to take down servers should they become infected/compromised and to create and deploy new clean ones, we have an automated suite of tests against cyber attacks, we use 2-factor authentication whenever possible, and more. We don\u0026rsquo;t run background checks on employees nor have CISSP certifications or have audit logs.\nOur Balsamiq Cloud service has never been compromised so far.\nShould our systems get compromised, we will replace the server(s) that have been hacked with new ones (we can do this with very few clicks). If this doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop the attack, we\u0026rsquo;ll shut down the service until we can fix the vulnerability. We will also hire outside experts to help us and verify that we\u0026rsquo;re safe to resume service.\nWhat Should I Do If I Find a Security Vulnerability in Balsamiq Cloud? If you have discovered a security concern, please email us at security@balsamiq.com. We’ll work with you to make sure that we understand the scope of the issue, and that we fully address your concern. We consider correspondence sent to security@balsamiq.com our highest priority, and work to address any issues that arise as quickly as possible.\nPlease act in good faith towards our users’ privacy and data during your disclosure. We won’t take legal action against you or administrative action against your account if you act accordingly: White hat researchers are always appreciated.\nCan I Run Balsamiq Cloud on My Own Servers, behind the Firewall? No, and it\u0026rsquo;s not planned. We offer other solutions (Mockups 3 for Desktop, plugin versions) that allow you to keep your data on your servers. Compare our products here.\nIntellectual Property Rights Who Owns Balsamiq Materials? Balsamiq Materials are all the information, data, documents (e.g. white papers, press releases, datasheets, FAQs, etc.), communications, downloads, files, text, images, photographs, graphics, videos, webcasts, publications, content, tools, resources, software, code, programs and products on Balsamiq Cloud produced by Balsamiq.\nBalsamiq Materials are protected by copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and all other intellectual property and proprietary rights, and any unauthorized use of the Balsamiq Materials may violate such laws and the Terms of Use.\nYou agree not to copy, republish, frame, download, transmit, modify, adapt, create derivative works based on, rent, lease, loan, sell, assign, distribute, display, perform, license, sublicense or reverse engineer the Balsamiq Cloud service or Balsamiq Materials or any portions of them.\nYou agree that you will not decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the software. Any copying or redistribution of the software is prohibited, including any copying or reproduction of the software to any other server or location for further reproduction, redistribution or use on a service bureau basis. Any unauthorized use, copying or distribution of the software is expressly prohibited by law, and may result in severe civil and criminal penalties. Violators will be prosecuted to the maximum extent possible.\nThe trademarks, logos and service marks displayed on this Site are the property of Balsamiq Studios, LLC or other third parties. You are not permitted to use them without the prior written consent of Balsamiq Studios, LLC or such third party that may own the Marks. Balsamiq and the Balsamiq logo are trademarks of Giacomo Guilizzoni, licensed to Balsamiq Studios, LLC.\n Balsamiq Materials may not be modified or altered in any way. Balsamiq Materials on Balsamiq Cloud may not be distributed or sold, rented, leased, licensed or otherwise made available to others. You may not remove any copyright or other proprietary notices contained in the Balsamiq Materials. You may not copy or distribute any graphics in the Balsamiq Materials apart from their accompanying text. You will not quote or display Balsamiq Materials, or any portions thereof, out of context. Balsamiq reserves the right to revoke the authorization to view, download and print the Balsamiq Materials available via Balsamiq Cloud at any time, and any such use shall be discontinued immediately upon notice from Balsamiq. The rights granted to you constitute a license and not a transfer of title. Any Balsamiq Materials made available only upon payment of a fee may only be viewed, downloaded and printed subject to your payment of such fee.  Who Owns the IP of My Wireframes and Assets? Balsamiq does not claim intellectual property rights over wireframes created on Balsamiq Cloud nor the assets your users upload.\nWe leave it to each Balsamiq Cloud Space Owner(s) to decide who should own the IP of the wireframes created using their Balsamiq Cloud Space. We encourage Space Owners to make their policy clear to their Space\u0026rsquo;s users, either via email or by posting it on their Balsamiq Cloud Space.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Balsamiq has no liability of any kind should anyone you granted access to your content modify, destroy, corrupt, copy or distribute it, or violate the terms of use or other limitations that you may impose on the use of your shared content.\nBalsamiq does not pre-screen user materials that users provide or otherwise submit via Balsamiq Cloud; however, Balsamiq may remove any posted or submitted user materials from Balsamiq Cloud for any reason without notice in its sole discretion. By posting or submitting your user materials, you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the intellectual property rights and other rights to your user materials as described in these Terms of Use, including all the rights necessary for you to post or submit your user materials.\nIn addition, by posting or otherwise submitting your user materials that contain images, photographs, pictures, videos, webcasts or that are otherwise graphical in whole or in part (“Images”), you represent and warrant that: (a) you own the copyright in such Images, or that you have obtained all necessary license(s) from the copyright owner(s) of such Images to use such Images, or portions thereof, in keeping with your use in connection with Balsamiq Cloud and as otherwise permitted by these Terms of Use; (b) in the event you choose to grant licenses and sublicenses to such Images, you have the rights necessary to grant the licenses and sublicenses described in these Terms of Use; and \u0026copy; you have received consent from any and all persons depicted in such Images to use the Images as set forth in these Terms of Use, including the distribution, public display, public performance and reproduction of such Images.\nYou are solely and entirely responsible for all of your user materials that you post or otherwise submit via Balsamiq Cloud. You shall assume all risks associated with the use of your user materials including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of your user materials. Balsamiq does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of your user materials. You acknowledge and agree that by accessing or using Balsamiq Cloud, you may be exposed to user materials from others that are offensive, indecent or otherwise objectionable.\nReliability Do You Guarantee That Balsamiq Cloud Will Be Accessible at All Times? In short, we do not. Like all other cloud-based applications, we are vulnerable to the inherent unreliability of the Internet. We do not offer contracted SLA for availability to Balsamiq Cloud and your data.\nThat said, high reliability is something we are proud of and something we deliberately chose to compete on. We have developers, system administrators and support staff on call, 24 / 7.\nWe monitor Balsamiq Cloud closely and have set up automated alarms to be notified (via email and SMS) when the Balsamiq Cloud service is under stress, so that we can deal with the issue before it becomes a problem that might impact customer access.\nYou can see for yourself how we\u0026rsquo;re doing on this front by looking at this Pingdom-powered chart (click for more history):\n\nYou acknowledge and agree that Balsamiq shall not be liable for any failure to store your materials on Balsamiq Cloud at any time.\nHow Is Our Data Backed Up? Your wireframe data, images, Space settings and projects information are saved (unencrypted) in our database, which runs on Amazon RDS. We have a real-time backup to a slave instance in a different availability zone (for added resilience) and we keep daily database snapshots of the last 3 days. Data is replicated in 3 different data centers.\nHow Quickly Can You Recover from a Data Center Disaster? This depends on the scale of the disaster, of course.\nWe spread our app servers amongst several availability zones within the us-east-1 region, and have survived several outages in one or more zones without any downtime.\nShould the whole us-east-1 region be affected by an outage, it would probably take us up to a week to set up everything in a new region, assuming we\u0026rsquo;d still be able to get to our backup data.\nPlay Nice Clauses Use of Balsamiq Cloud You agree that you shall not:\n Collect, harvest, mine or engage in any other activity to obtain e-mail addresses, phone numbers, personal information or any other information about others. Use or attempt to gain access to or use another’s user or company account, password, data, or computer systems or networks connected to any Balsamiq Cloud server, whether through hacking, password mining or any other means. Access or attempt to access any material that you are not authorized to access.

A note to other startups: working on a great new startup but don\u0026rsquo;t know where to start when it comes to ToS documents? Go ahead and copy/paste this document, search and replace and make it yours! :) Two things though: a) make sure to have it looked over by your lawyer - you do have a lawyer right? ;) - and b) we\u0026rsquo;d appreciate a backlink, even in small gray-on-white font at the very bottom. You\u0026rsquo;ll get good karma points, which is just what new startups needs the most. :) Good luck!\n"

Jira Administrators: the Mockups for Jira Server Admin Guide is for you.\nAdding a UI Mockup to a Jira Issue To add a UI Mockup to a particular Jira issue you simply click on the “Add/Edit UI Mockup to this issue” link:\nYou will be taken to the Mockups editor, where you can create your mockup (or import an existing mockup).\nIf you have never used Balsamiq Mockups before, here\u0026rsquo;s a quick video introduction of what you can do with it when using the Jira Server plugin:\n When you are happy with your mockup, you simply go to the Mockup menu:\nand select “Save and Close”.\nYou will be prompted to name your mockup, and the software will auto-generate a simple date-based name for you, which is handy when you have many mockups on the same issue:\nYou can just hit enter to accept that name or give it whatever name you wish.\nYou will be taken back to the issue. Here\u0026rsquo;s a sample one (click for a larger view):\n\nNotice how the UI Mockup is now attached to the issue, both as an image and as a bmml data file. Also notice how Mockups for Jira Server has added a comment to the issue for you, saying “Added UI Mockup: \u0026lt;mockup name\u0026gt;“. This means that if any of your co-workers is watching the issue, they’ll get an email notification to check out your new work of art. :)\nNote: Even if your Balsamiq Mockups for Jira Server license is configured so that only specific people can create and edit mockups (explained in the Admin Guide), anyone with access to your Jira site will be able to see them.

It gets better!\nHow to Edit / Iterate on Mockups Say you want to tweak an existing UI mockup or create a new mockup as a variation of an existing one. The workflow is simple. Click the “Add/Edit UI Mockup to this issue” link again:\nThis time you will be presented with a dialog like this one:\nYou will then be able to either start from a blank canvas or edit an existing Mockup from the ones already attached to the current issue.\nTo simply iterate on the same mockup, you just select “Save and Close” from the Mockups menu, to create a new mockup variation, you select “Save as New Mockup” instead.\nIf you select “Save and Close”, you’ll have a chance to enter an optional comment about your edit:\nAs the dialog says, if you leave the field blank no notifications will be sent. Otherwise your comment will appear on the Issue’s comments list, and watchers will be notified.\nThat’s it!\nFor instructions on how to use the mockup editor itself, please refer to the application overview.\n"

    "description": "",
    "content": " Welcome This page contains usage instructions for Mockups for Confluence Server.\nUsing Confluence Cloud? If you are using Confluence Cloud (on atlassian.net), please see this article instead. Confluence Server Administrators: the Mockups for Confluence Server Admin Guide is for you.\nCreating a New Mockup Adding a mockup to a wiki page is very similar to adding an image.\nEdit the page, position the cursor where you\u0026rsquo;d like your mockup to be, then click on the Insert menu and select \u0026ldquo;UI Mockup\u0026rdquo; from the list.\nThis will take you directly to the Balsamiq Mockup editor, where you can create your mockup (or import an existing mockup).\nIf you have never used Balsamiq Mockups before, here\u0026rsquo;s a little intro of what you can do with it when using the Confluence Server plugin:\n Once you are happy with your mockup, just select \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; from the toolbar or the Mockup menu. You will be asked to give it a unique name. This is required and allows you to include more than one mockup on the same page.\nOnce you name your mockup you can continue working on it and saving it periodically.\nWhen you are ready to go back to the wiki page, just click on \u0026ldquo;Close\u0026rdquo; or select \u0026ldquo;Close Editor\u0026rdquo; from the Mockup menu. You will be taken back to the Confluence editor. Save the page and you\u0026rsquo;re done!\nNote: Even if your Balsamiq Mockups license is configured so that only specific people can create and edit mockups (explained in the Admin Guide), anyone with access to your Confluence site will be able to see them. Editing a Mockup To make changes to a mockup, edit the wiki page, select the mockup image and click on the \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026rdquo; button in the little macro control panel that shows up.\nDeleting a Mockup To remove a mockup from a page, simply edit the page, select the mockup and delete it or click on \u0026ldquo;Remove\u0026rdquo;.\nLooking at a Mockup\u0026rsquo;s History Each UI mockup is saved as two separate attachments, one for the PNG image and one for the BMML source data. Confluence supports versioning of attachments, and Balsamiq Mockups takes advantage of it so that you can see how your mockup evolved over time, or roll back to a previous version.\n​\nRolling Back to a Previous Version of a Mockup This is a bit tricky but it can be done. Go to the attachments view for your page, find the mockup you want to roll back, get the BMML for the version you want to roll it back to and copy it. Now you can go back to the page, edit the mockup and import your old BMML via the \u0026ldquo;Import\u0026rdquo; dialog.\nMoving a Mockup on a Page To move a mockup to a different location on a page you edit the page, select it in the editor and use cut and paste to move it to another location on the page. Save the page and you\u0026rsquo;re done!\nAligning a Mockup on a Page If you\u0026rsquo;d like to left-align or right-align the mockup\u0026rsquo;s image relative to your page, you can do so via the macro control panel. Note that the macro won\u0026rsquo;t align while in edit mode, but it will show up with the right alignment once you save the wiki page.\nSpecifying the Size of a Mockup on a Page You can use the \u0026ldquo;Small\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Medium\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Original\u0026rdquo; buttons in the macro property panel.\nAdding an Existing Confluence Mockup to a New Confluence Page You may want to add a mockup that you\u0026rsquo;ve already created in Confluence to a different page than you initially created it for. Right now you can only add mockups that are attached to the same page. However, you can create a copy of the mockup you want and add it to the new page. The fastest way to do that is via Export/Import. This process involves exporting from the old one and importing into a new one. You can also see the steps below for moving a mockup from one page to another.\nMoving a Mockup from One Page to Another It is possible to move mockups from one page to another. However, this is somewhat of an \u0026ldquo;advanced\u0026rdquo; feature, so it\u0026rsquo;s not as easy as the tasks described above.\nHere are the steps:\n Go to the Attachments page and move both the .bmml and .png files (both file types should have a \u0026ldquo;mockup_\u0026rdquo; prefix) to the page you wish to move the mockup to (refer to the Confluence documentation for more information). On the new page, Edit the page and type the following text:  {mockup:Name= *the name of the mockup without the \u0026ldquo;mockup_\u0026rdquo; prefix or the .bmml extension (so \u0026ldquo;mockup_login screen.bmml\u0026rdquo; would become \u0026ldquo;login screen\u0026rdquo;)* }\nresulting in something like this {mockup:Name=login screen}.  After doing this, you should see your mockup appear in the editor.  This process can also be useful if you have removed a mockup from a page and want to re-add it. In that case, skip step 1 and follow steps 2-4.\nNote: Any images used in mockups will have to be moved as well - and re-added to the mockup. Renaming a Mockup Similar to the process described above, renaming a mockup is possible, but you have to go behind the scenes to do it.\nHere are the steps:\n Go to the Attachments page and rename both the .bmml and .png files (click on Properties and change the file name). Make sure to keep the \u0026ldquo;mockup_\u0026rdquo; prefix for both files. Go back to the page the mockup was on (you should see an error where it used to be). Edit the page, then delete the macro placeholder for the old mockup name. In its place, type the following text:  {mockup:Name= *the name of the renamed mockup without the \u0026ldquo;mockup_\u0026rdquo; prefix or the .bmml extension (so \u0026ldquo;mockup_new name.bmml\u0026rdquo; would become \u0026ldquo;new name\u0026rdquo;)* }\nresulting in something like this {mockup:Name=new name}.  After doing this, you should see your mockup appear in the editor.  Exporting a Mockup Mockups for Confluence Server allows you to export your mockup to XML format so that you can import it to our other versions. It is not currently possible to export directly to PDF or an image (PNG, etc.) from the Balsamiq Mockups editor.\nAs mentioned above, however, you can access your mockups in PNG image format by going to the attachments for the Confluence page.\nYou can also take advantage of the ability to export to PDF within Confluence to export your wiki page, including any mockups, to PDF.\n"

If you are using Jira Cloud (on atlassian.net), please see this article instead. Usage instructions for the plugin are in the Mockups for Jira Server Introduction.\nInstallation Instructions Like most Atlassian add-ons, Balsamiq Mockups for Jira is installed via Atlassian\u0026rsquo;s Universal Plugin Manager, or UPM. Make sure you are running an updated version of UPM before attempting to install the plugin (UPM installation instructions).\nTo install the plugin, go to the Jira Administration page. Select \u0026ldquo;Find new add-ons\u0026rdquo; and search for Balsamiq Mockups for Jira Server.\nSelect \u0026ldquo;Free Trial\u0026rdquo; and accept the license agreement for Mockups for Jira Server to begin the installation.\nOnce the plugin has downloaded and installed, you\u0026rsquo;ll be prompted to Log In with your Atlassian ID or MyAtlassian account to obtain an evaluation key. You will then begin a 30-day trial evaluation of Mockups for Jira Server.\nRegistration Instructions Please make sure you read the Balsamiq and Atlassian Marketplace FAQ first.\nTo register the plugin, go to the Jira Administration page. Select \u0026ldquo;Manage new add-ons\u0026rdquo; and search for Balsamiq Mockups for Jira Server.\nIf you want to buy from Atlassian Marketplace, you can use the Buy now button.\nIf you already bought a license from Atlassian Marketplace, you can paste it in the text area and click the Update button to save it.\nIf instead you purchased your license directly from Balsamiq, you\u0026rsquo;ll either see a Configure button or a Configure link (depending on your UPM version). Click on it and follow the instructions on the configuration page to paste your License Information and see the status of your current installation.\nIf you have a Marketplace trial license installed, you might not see a Configure button at all. Delete your Marketplace License Key and hit update to make the Configure button re-appear. This will allow you to enter a Balsamiq-issued license instead.\nBelow are a few screenshots of what you can expect there.\nThis is what you\u0026rsquo;ll see if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a license installed and select the Balsamiq option.\nThis is what you\u0026rsquo;ll see if you have installed a license you purchase via Atlassian Marketplace.

    "content": " Welcome The Mockups 2 for Confluence Server Admin Guide contains installation, registration, updating and uninstalling instructions for Mockups for Confluence Server when installed on your own server.\nUsing Confluence Cloud? If you are using Confluence Cloud (on atlassian.net), please see this article instead. Usage instructions for the plugin are here.\nInstallation Instructions Like most plugins, Balsamiq Mockups for Confluence Server is installed via Atlassian\u0026rsquo;s Universal Plugin Manager, or UPM. Make sure you are running an updated version of UPM before attempting to install the plugin.\nTo install the plugin, go to the Confluence Administration page. Select \u0026ldquo;Find new add-ons\u0026rdquo; and search for Balsamiq Mockups for Confluence Server.\nSelect \u0026ldquo;Free Trial\u0026rdquo; and accept the license agreement for Mockups for Confluence Server to begin the installation.\nOnce the plugin has downloaded and installed, you\u0026rsquo;ll be prompted to Log In with your Atlassian ID or MyAtlassian account to obtain an evaluation key.\nYou will then begin a 30-day trial evaluation of Mockups for Confluence Server.\nRegistration Instructions Please make sure you read the Balsamiq and Atlassian Marketplace FAQ first.\nTo register the plugin, go to the Confluence Administration page. Select \u0026ldquo;Manage new add-ons\u0026rdquo; and search for Balsamiq Mockups for Confluence Server.\nIf you have UPM v.2 and want to buy from Atlassian Marketplace, you can use the Buy now button.\nIf you already bought a license from Atlassian Marketplace, you can paste it in the text area and click the Update button to save it.\nIf instead you purchased your license directly from Balsamiq, you\u0026rsquo;ll either see a Configure button or a Configure link (depending on your UPM version). Click on it and follow the instructions on the configuration page to paste your License Information and see the status of your current installation.\nIf you have a Marketplace trial license installed, you might not see a Configure button at all. Delete your Marketplace License Key and hit update to make the Configure button re-appear. This will allow you to enter a Balsamiq-issued license instead.\nBelow are a few screenshots of what you can expect there.\nThis is what you\u0026rsquo;ll see if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a license installed and select the Balsamiq option.\nThis is what you\u0026rsquo;ll see if you have installed a license you purchase via Atlassian Marketplace.\nThis is what you\u0026rsquo;ll see if you have a license you purchased from Balsamiq but select the Atlassian option. Note that an Atlassian Markeplace license, if installed, trumps any existing Balsamiq license.\nIf you receive an error when registering, this FAQ may help.\nUPM still showing the plugin as \u0026ldquo;Unlicensed\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Free Trial\u0026rdquo; after you install the Balsamiq-issued license? This FAQ is for you.\nSelecting Mockup Editors If you purchased your plugin license via Atlassian Marketplace\nAll of your Confluence users will be able to access the plugin.\nIf you purchased your plugin license from Balsamiq\nIf your plugin license is lower than your Confluence license, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to create a Confluence user group called balsamiq-mockups-editors and add people to it manually.\nYou can add and remove users to this group whenever you like, just make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t add more than what your plugin license allows for or everyone will see a warning.\nIf instead you bought an unlimited version of the plugin, everyone will be able to create and edit mockups.\nUpdating Instructions Click on the Update button on your UPM to download and install the latest version of the plugin.\nIf you are running an old version of Confluence and want to figure out which version of the plugin to update to, head to the Support End of Life Policy page.\nUninstalling Instructions You can uninstall the plugin from UPM.\nThe mockups created so far will disappear from the wiki pages because the {mockup} macro won\u0026rsquo;t be there any more, but the mockup data (and images) will NOT be deleted, they\u0026rsquo;ll just be there in the attachments to the pages they were created on.\nTroubleshooting If You Get an Error When Trying to Save Large Mockups When saving large mockups, you might get a 2032 error. This is due to the fact that Tomcat has a 2MB default to the maximum size of a POST request, which is what we use to save the mockup image.\nThe good news is that this default can be changed: just edit your confluence/conf/server.xml and set maxPostSize to a higher value. Restart Confluence and you\u0026rsquo;ll be all set. Your Confluence might even run faster because of it!\nIf you have other troubles, email us and we\u0026rsquo;ll help you!\nMockups and Adaptivist\u0026rsquo;s Theme Builder Integration If you are using Adaptivist\u0026rsquo;s Theme Builder, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to manually add a \u0026ldquo;Add UI Mockup\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; link to the edit menu. Here\u0026rsquo;s how:\n Go to Theme Builder\u0026rsquo;s Layout Manager (administration / themes / configure theme / layout manager) Go to the Menus tab and click \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; at the bottom Go to the Edit Menu tab and add the following right under the \u0026ldquo;Comment\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; compound-menuitem: {menuseparator} {compound-menuitem:webui|location=system.content.add/space| key=com_balsamiq_confluence_plugins_mockups_menu_addmockup| caption=Add UI Mockup...} Save your layout  That\u0026rsquo;s it! you will now see a nice \u0026ldquo;Add UI Mockup\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; link in your edit menu.\n"

Confluence Cloud Administrators: the Balsamiq Wireframes for Confluence Cloud Admin Guide is for you.\nBalsamiq Wireframes for Confluence Cloud provides very similar functionality to Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop.\nThe main difference is that the Balsamiq project files are stored and managed as Confluence Cloud attachments.\n Adding a New Project to a Confluence Page Adding a new Balsamiq Wireframes project to a wiki page is very similar to adding an image.\nEdit the page, position the cursor where you’d like your wireframes to be, then click on the Insert menu and select “Balsamiq Wireframes” from the list.\nThe link will launch the Balsamiq Wireframes editor to allow you to create your wireframes (or import existing ones). This will also create a new Balsamiq Wireframes file (.bmpr file extension) attached to your wiki page containing all the resources that belong to a project (wireframes, symbols, images, icons).\nIf you do not see the menu item, please check with your Confluence administrator that the Balsamiq Wireframes for Confluence Cloud add-on is installed and that you have editing permission on the current page.\nUsing the Balsamiq Wireframes Editor The Balsamiq Wireframes editor allows you to create wireframes just like our other products. Start with the application overview to learn more about using the editor.\nCollaborating with Other Users in Real Time Balsamiq Wireframes for Confluence Cloud supports real-time collaboration between users: just have everyone launch the editor on the same project. Everyone’s changes will be shared in real-time with all collaborators.\nThe other connected users will be shown in the top right of the screen. Hovering over their picture shows their Confluence username.\nCopying or Moving Wireframes between Projects Sometimes you might want to copy or move a wireframe from one project to another. Here is a simple way to do it:\n Open the two projects (each in its own browser tab or window) In the source project, select the wireframe you want to copy or move. Select all the controls from this wireframe (CTRL/CMD+A) and copy the controls (CTRL/CMD+C) In the target project, paste your controls (CTRL/CMD+V) in a newly created wireframe  That’s it! You may now delete the wireframe from the source project if you wish.\nNote: Symbols and images won’t get transferred in this process. You will have to manually add them to the target project. Alternatively, you can also use the JSON feature, available in the Export menu:\n Open the two projects In the source project, select the wireframe you want to copy or move. In the Project menu, select Export \u0026gt; Wireframe to JSON\u0026hellip; This will put a text-based representation of the wireframe in the clipboard. In the target project, select Import \u0026gt; Wireframe JSON\u0026hellip; from the Project menu. In the dialog that pops up, paste the content of the clipboard with CTRL/CMD+V and click the Import button.  Importing from Other Versions of Balsamiq If you have a project created in another Balsamiq product (using the .bmpr extension), the easiest way to import it is to create a new project and use the Project \u0026gt; Import \u0026gt; Import from BMPR option.\nExporting to Other Versions of Balsamiq To export your project to another Balsamiq product, all you need to do is download it and open it there. Selecting the Project \u0026gt; Export \u0026gt; Download Project BMPR option will create a .bmpr file to download containing all the wireframes, symbols, and images used in the current project.\nSaving the Project All the changes made on your project in the editor are always autosaved and visible by the collaborators that are editing the same project in real time.\nHowever, the changes made in editing mode (i.e. inside the Balsamiq Wireframes editor) will not be flushed to the official version that is attached to the Confluence page until the project is expressly saved.\nThis can be done by selecting the Project \u0026gt; Save Project option or by simply closing the editor.\nReturning to Confluence (Closing the Editor) When you are done editing your wireframes, you can exit the editor by selecting Project \u0026gt; Exit Back to Confluence.\nThis will also save the current project and update the version that will be now visible in the Balsamiq Wireframes macro.\nAlternatively, you can perform the same action by clicking on the breadcrumb link pointing to the Confluence page containing your BMPR project, on the top-left part of the menu bar.\nUsing the Balsamiq Wireframes Macro Once you have created a new project, the Balsamiq Wireframes macro will appear on your Confluence page.\nThe macro looks like a plain image, but when your mouse is over it, a control bar will appear. The control bar allows you to launch the editor on the selected wireframe or to enter Full Screen Presentation mode.\nEditing Existing Wireframes There are two ways to open the Balsamiq editor:\n Click the “edit” icon that next to the wireframe name in the macro or Full Screen viewer:  Edit the wiki page, enter the macro editor and launch the Balsamiq Wireframes editor:  Note: If you have read-only permission on an page, you will be still able to access the Full Screen viewer but you will not be able to edit the wireframes. Using the Balsamiq Wireframes Macro Editor Accessing the Balsamiq Wireframes Macro Editor can be done by following these steps:\n Click the “edit” icon that next to the wireframe name in the macro or Full Screen viewer Edit the wiki page, enter the macro editor  See the related screenshots above if needed.\nThe macro editor lets you configure the Balsamiq project view that will be shown in the Confluence page.\nYou can chose to show a thumbnail grid or, in case of the single wireframe view, you can configure the starting wireframe, the size and the alignment.\nTo add multiple views on the same project, just add more macros and select a different starting wireframe for each one.\nYou can also launch the Balsamiq Wireframes Editor and continue to edit your project from there.\n"

Importing from Other Versions of Balsamiq If you have a project created in another Balsamiq product (using the .bmpr extension), the easiest way to import it is to create a new project and use the \u0026ldquo;Project \u0026gt; Import \u0026gt; Import from BMPR..\u0026rdquo; option.\nExporting to Other Versions of Balsamiq To export your project to another Balsamiq product, all you need to do is download it and open it there. Selecting the Project \u0026gt; Export \u0026gt; Download Project BMPR option will create a .bmpr file to download containing all the wireframes, symbols, and images used in the current project.\nSaving the Project All the changes made on your project in the editor are always autosaved and visible by the collaborators that are editing the same project in real time.\nHowever, the changes made in editing mode (i.e. inside the Balsamiq Wireframes editor) will not be flushed to the official version that is attached to the Jira issue until the project is expressly saved.\nThis can be done by selecting the Project \u0026gt; Save Project option or by simply closing the editor.\nReturning to Jira (Closing the Editor) When you are done editing your wireframes you can exit the editor by selecting the Project \u0026gt; Exit Back to Jira option. This will also save the current project and update the version that will be now visible on the Balsamiq Wireframes Panel.\nAlternatively, you can perform the same action by clicking on the breadcrumb link pointing to the issue containing your BMPR project, on the top-left part of the menu bar.\nUsing the Balsamiq Wireframes Panel Once you have created a new project, the Balsamiq Wireframes Panel will appear on your Jira issue.\nThe panel will show the thumbnails of the wireframes contained in the currently saved version of the Balsamiq project. A variety of actions are available from the Balsamiq Wireframes Panel.\nEditing Existing Wireframes There are two ways to open the editor from the Balsamiq Wireframes panel:\n You can click the \u0026ldquo;edit\u0026rdquo; icon that is shown when your mouse is over each thumbnail. The editor will open showing the selected wireframe. You can click the Edit button: the editor will open the project on the first wireframe.  Note: If you have read-only permission on an issue, you will still be able to access the Full Screen viewer but you will not be able to edit the wireframes. Adding a New Wireframe Clicking the Add Wireframe button will open the editor and create a new wireframes named \u0026ldquo;New Wireframe 1\u0026rdquo;.\nYou can also add wireframes directly from within the Balsamiq Wireframes editor.\nDeleting the Project If you want to remove a project from the Jira issue you can use the Delete Project button.\nNote: This action can not be undone.

    "content": " This page contains usage instructions for Balsamiq Wireframes for Jira Server.\nUsing Jira Cloud? Please see this article instead. Jira Server Administrators: the Balsamiq Wireframes for Jira Server Admin Guide is for you.\nNote: Balsamiq Wireframes for Jira Server was released on September, 2017. See our transition guide if you have the older pre-installed version of wireframes for Jira. Balsamiq Wireframes for Jira Server provides very similar functionality to Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop. The main difference is that the Balsamiq project files are stored and managed as Jira Server attachments.\n Adding a New Project to a Jira Issue To add a new Balsamiq Wireframes project to a particular Jira issue, you simply need to click on the \u0026ldquo;Add Balsamiq Wireframes\u0026rdquo; menu option.\nThis will launch the Balsamiq Wireframes editor, where you can create your wireframes (or import existing ones). This will also create a new Balsamiq Project file (.bmpr file extension) attached to your Jira issue containing all the resources that belong to a project (wireframes, symbols, images, icons).\nIf you do not see the menu option, please check with your Jira Server administrator that the Balsamiq Wireframes for Jira Server add-on is installed and that you have editing permission on the current issue.\nUsing the Balsamiq Wireframes Editor The Balsamiq Wireframes editor allows you to create wireframes just like our other products. Start with the application overview to learn more about using the editor.\nCollaborating with Other Users in Real Time Balsamiq Wireframes for Jira Server supports real-time collaboration between users. You only need to have everyone launch the editor on the same project. Everyone’s changes are shared in real-time with all your collaborators.\nThe other users connected will be shown in the top right corner of the editor. Hovering over their picture shows their Jira username.\nCopying or Moving Wireframes between Projects Sometimes you might want to copy or move a wireframe from one project to another. Here is a simple way to do it:\n Open the two projects (each in its own browser tab or window) In the source project, select the wireframe you want to copy or move. Select all the controls from this wireframe (CTRL/CMD+A) and copy the controls (CTRL/CMD+C) In the target project, paste your controls (CTRL/CMD+V) in a newly created wireframe  That’s it! You may now delete the wireframe from the source project if you wish.\nNote: Symbols and images won’t get transferred in this process. You will have to manually add them to the target project. Alternatively, you can also use the JSON feature, available in the Export menu:\n Open the two projects In the source project, select the wireframe you want to copy or move. In the Project menu, select Export \u0026gt; Wireframe to JSON\u0026hellip; This will put a text-based representation of the wireframe in the clipboard. In the target project, select Import \u0026gt; Wireframe JSON\u0026hellip; from the Project menu. In the dialog that pops up, paste the content of the clipboard with CTRL/CMD+V and click the Import button.  Importing from Other Versions of Balsamiq If you have a project created in another Balsamiq product (using the .bmpr extension), the easiest way to import it is to create a new project and use the \u0026ldquo;Project \u0026gt; Import \u0026gt; Import from BMPR..\u0026rdquo; option.\nExporting to Other Versions of Balsamiq To export your project to another Balsamiq product, all you need to do is download it and open it there.

Click on it and follow the instructions on the configuration page to paste your License Information and see the status of your current installation.\nIf you have a Marketplace trial license installed, you might not see a Configure button at all.

This is due to the fact that Tomcat has a 2MB default to the maximum size of a POST request, which is what we use to save the Balsamiq project file and images.\nThe good news is that this default can be changed: just edit your $CONFLUENCE_HOME/conf/server.xml and set maxPostSize to a higher value.

    "content": " Overview Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive allows you to add and edit wireframes directly from Google Drive, where the files are stored and managed. If you use other Google Drive apps (Google Docs, for example), the file management features should be very familiar to you.\nWith easy sharing, version control and even real-time collaboration, Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive makes iterating on wireframes easy and fun. To learn how to sign up for or manage a subscription, check out the Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive subscription FAQ.\nGetting Started The instructions for installing Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive can be found on this page.\nFor a quick overview before starting to use the application, check out this 5 minute video covering the main features of Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive.\n Creating a New Project There are two ways to create a new Balsamiq Wireframes project in Google Drive.\n You can click \u0026ldquo;New \u0026gt; Balsamiq Wireframes\u0026rdquo; from the Google Drive file list as shown above.   If you are using the Chrome browser, you can also launch Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive from the Chrome Apps tab (open a new tab and type \u0026ldquo;chrome://apps/\u0026ldquo;). Click the big Balsamiq Wireframes icon and it will open the editor directly.  ​Either method will launch the Balsamiq Wireframes editor, allowing you to create your wireframes (or import existing ones).\nThis will also create a new project file (.bmpr file extension) in your Google Drive. If you launched Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive from the Chrome Apps page, your file will be saved in your Drive’s home folder. Otherwise it will be saved in the folder selected when you created the new Balsamiq Wireframes project.\nNote: Your work is always automatically saved on Google Drive as you make edits. To exit the editor, simply use the \u0026ldquo;Back to Google Drive\u0026rdquo; option in the Project menu. Using the Balsamiq Wireframes Editor The Balsamiq Wireframes editor allows you to create wireframes just like our other products. Start with the application overview to learn more about using the editor.\nImporting from Other Versions If you have a project created in another Balsamiq product (using the .bmpr extension), the easiest way to import it is to create a new project and use the \u0026ldquo;Project \u0026gt; Import \u0026gt; Import from BMPR\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; option.\nReturning to Google Drive (Closing the Editor) When you are done editing your wireframes you can exit the editor by selecting “Back to Google Drive” in the Project menu. This will also create a new version of the file in case you want to revert to it later.\nAlternatively, you can perform the same action by clicking on the breadcrumb link pointing to the parent folder of your BMPR project, on the top-left part of the menu bar.\nCollaborating with Other Users in Real Time Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive supports real-time collaboration between users. See Collaborative Editing for more details.\n"

    "content": " A variety of actions are available from the Google Drive file viewer, by selecting a file and clicking one of the icons in the Google Drive toolbar or by right-clicking on the file.\nNote: These actions are common to all types of files in Google Drive, so not all of them are described here. For general help on getting around in Google Drive, check out the Google Drive Help Center. Sharing via Google Drive Wireframes created with Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive are saved as .bmpr files that can be shared just like any other document in Google Drive. To share your wireframes, select the .bmpr file and click the share button in the Google Drive toolbar (or right-click on the file \u0026gt; Share).\nYou can also share it directly from within the editor, by using the dedicated icon in the toolbar.\nNote: If you give the other person “Can view” or “Can comment” permission, they will be able to view and comment your wireframes but not edit them. On the other users\u0026rsquo; end, the Balsamiq file appears in “Shared with me” and they can see a preview of it.\n If users have Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive already installed, they can just double-click on the file to open it.\n If they do not have Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive installed, they will be prompted to install it by selecting the \u0026ldquo;Open with\u0026rdquo; option from the Google Drive file viewer (see menu above). Double-clicking the file will also reveal the \u0026ldquo;Open with\u0026rdquo; option on top of the page.\n  Remember that viewing wireframes and commenting with Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive is free, it’s only the editing functionality that require a valid subscription after the trial expires. So share away!\nAlternatively, you can export your wireframes to PNG images or to an interactive PDF and use sharing in Google Drive to allow others to view them. See Exporting Your Wireframes for more information.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve shared your wireframes with another person, you can both work on them at the same time, as detailed in Collaborative Editing.\nMoving Wireframes to a Different Folder Just like other Google Drive files, you can move your wireframes around to various folders on your Google Drive. You may want to create one folder for all your Balsamiq files or separate them by project.\nRename, Delete, Copy To rename, delete, or make a copy of a Balsamiq file, select one of these options from the Google Drive actions menu (via right-click or the toolbar).\nManaging Versions You can see previous versions of your wireframes via the Google Drive interface. Right-click on the .bmpr file, select \u0026ldquo;Manage Versions\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; and you will be presented with a list of old versions. If needed, you can easily download a specific version from the context menu on the right.\nNote: A new version is created each time you quit the application or if you manually save via the editor menu (Project \u0026gt; Save Project).

    "description": "",
    "content": " Our Atlassian server add-ons include a built-in, behind the firewall real-time collaboration service (RTC) that allows multiple users to work on the same project, at the same time. This documentation is to help administrators understand how the service is implemented, and potentially help them solve problems with it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a service on the main application server that needs to be configured according to the existing network layout. Except for common setups (direct connection to tomcat), you need administration access to the server console to edit reverse proxy configuration files or open the desired port.\nConfluence/Jira administration permissions are needed to modify the RTC plugin configuration (set the FQDN, set the RTC port, verify if RTC is up or restart it).\nNote: To avoid mixed content (HTTP+HTTPS on the same webpage), the connection protocol has to be the same (client/server and RTC), so HTTP for both or HTTPS for both.\nExample: if SSL is terminated at the reverse proxy, and proxied to HTTP (tomcat), the same thing should happen for RTC (default port 9083-9093)\n Possible Configurations JIRA/Confluence application server can be installed with different network configurations. Depending on the configuration, the RTC configuration page shows different protocol values:\nIf the protocol field in the configuration page shows HTTP, the plugin is guessing that the protocol during the full network path (client/\u0026lt;proxy if existing\u0026gt;/server) is HTTP.\nIf it shows HTTPS, the protocol used is HTTPS for all the network path.\nIf it shows HTTP + SSL, the protocol used is HTTPS to the reverse proxy, then HTTP to the tomcat server.\nHere are different network configurations related to protocol value (shown in RTC plugin configuration page):\n HTTP configuration examples HTTP + SSL configuration examples HTTPS configuration examples  Prerequisites Prerequisites valid for every scenario  It is possible to configure a desired port (that has to be free and beyond 1024, according to best practices) through the plugin configuration tab \u0026ldquo;Real-time Collaboration Service\u0026rdquo; (9083 is the default for confluence, 9093 for Jira). The selected TCP port for RTC has to be available and reachable on all the network path. verify that the fully qualified domain name of the server (or the proxy, in case of reverse proxy) is correct. In most cases, it\u0026rsquo;s the same as the FQDN of the Atlassian Server Base URL (if the Server Base URL is http://example.com/JIRA, the Server Name in the plugin configuration name has to be example.com  Prerequisites in case of reverse proxy  The selected TCP port for RTC has to be proxied to the application server (to the same port) proxy FQDN has to be solved and reachable by the application server  Prerequisites in case of HTTP + SSL  If the proxy is on the same host of the application server, tomcat server should be listening on a different IP (typically, with the parameter address=\u0026ldquo;127.0.0.1\u0026rdquo; inside server.xml) so that RTC connects to proxy on chosen port in the external interface (e.g. 192.168.1.64), then can be redirected to the same port the tomcat interface The Java runtime environment embedded in jira/confluence installation has to trust the SSL certificate of the proxy, so in case it is self signed or the root certificate unknown to Jre, it has to be imported into the embedded Jre.  Prerequisites for HTTPS  If tomcat directly terminate https, server.xml has to be configured to let Tomcat use the certificate file. RTC plugin reads these values directly from server.xml the Java runtime environment embedded in jira/confluence installation has to trust the SSL certificate, so in case it is self signed or the root certificate unknown to Jre, it has to be imported into the embedded Jre.  Prerequisites for both HTTPS and HTTP+SSL CA chain - HTTPS, HTTP+SSL:\nPlease pay attention that the application server (Tomcat) needs to access the proxy or the application server, so the full CA chain has to be trusted. If for testing purposes SSL certificate is self signed, it has to be imported at jre level in a similar way:\necho -n | openssl s_client -connect \u0026lt;jira|confluence_FQDN\u0026gt;:443 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' \u0026gt; /tmp/\u0026lt;jira|confluence_FQDN\u0026gt;.cert cd /opt/atlassian/\u0026lt;confluence|jira\u0026gt;/jre/bin ./keytool -keystore ../lib/security/cacerts -import -alias jira -file /tmp/\u0026lt;jira|confluence_FQDN\u0026gt;.cert  HTTP Configuration Examples  HTTP - direct connection   HTTP - proxy on different server   HTTP - proxy on same server   HTTP - data center  HTTP - direct connection Client connects (http) directly to tomcat (Atlassian service), no extra configuration is required.

    "description": "",
    "content": " Our Atlassian server add-ons include a built-in, behind the firewall real-time collaboration service (RTC) that allows multiple users to work on the same project, at the same time. This documentation is to help administrators understand how the service is implemented, and potentially help them solve problems with it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a service on the main application server that needs to be configured according to the existing network layout. Except for common setups (direct connection to tomcat), you need administration access to the server console to edit reverse proxy configuration files or open the desired port.\nConfluence/Jira administration permissions are needed to modify the RTC plugin configuration (set the FQDN, set the RTC port, verify if RTC is up or restart it).\nNote: To avoid mixed content (HTTP+HTTPS on the same webpage), the connection protocol has to be the same (client/server and RTC), so HTTP for both or HTTPS for both.\nExample: if SSL is terminated at the reverse proxy, and proxied to HTTP (tomcat), the same thing should happen for RTC (default port 9083-9093)\n Possible Configurations JIRA/Confluence application server can be installed with different network configurations. Depending on the configuration, the RTC configuration page shows different protocol values:\nIf the protocol field in the configuration page shows HTTP, the plugin is guessing that the protocol during the full network path (client/\u0026lt;proxy if existing\u0026gt;/server) is HTTP.\nIf it shows HTTPS, the protocol used is HTTPS for all the network path.\nIf it shows HTTP + SSL, the protocol used is HTTPS to the reverse proxy, then HTTP to the tomcat server.\nHere are different network configurations related to protocol value (shown in RTC plugin configuration page):\n HTTP configuration examples HTTP + SSL configuration examples HTTPS configuration examples  Prerequisites Prerequisites valid for every scenario  It is possible to configure a desired port (that has to be free and beyond 1024, according to best practices) through the plugin configuration tab \u0026ldquo;Real-time Collaboration Service\u0026rdquo; (9083 is the default for confluence, 9093 for Jira). The selected TCP port for RTC has to be available and reachable on all the network path. verify that the fully qualified domain name of the server (or the proxy, in case of reverse proxy) is correct. In most cases, it\u0026rsquo;s the same as the FQDN of the Atlassian Server Base URL (if the Server Base URL is http://example.com/JIRA, the Server Name in the plugin configuration name has to be example.com  Prerequisites in case of reverse proxy  The selected TCP port for RTC has to be proxied to the application server (to the same port) proxy FQDN has to be solved and reachable by the application server  Prerequisites in case of HTTP + SSL  If the proxy is on the same host of the application server, tomcat server should be listening on a different IP (typically, with the parameter address=\u0026ldquo;127.0.0.1\u0026rdquo; inside server.xml) so that RTC connects to proxy on chosen port in the external interface (e.g. 192.168.1.64), then can be redirected to the same port the tomcat interface The Java runtime environment embedded in jira/confluence installation has to trust the SSL certificate of the proxy, so in case it is self signed or the root certificate unknown to Jre, it has to be imported into the embedded Jre.  Prerequisites for HTTPS  If tomcat directly terminate https, server.xml has to be configured to let Tomcat use the certificate file. RTC plugin reads these values directly from server.xml the Java runtime environment embedded in jira/confluence installation has to trust the SSL certificate, so in case it is self signed or the root certificate unknown to Jre, it has to be imported into the embedded Jre.  Prerequisites for both HTTPS and HTTP+SSL CA chain - HTTPS, HTTP+SSL:\nPlease pay attention that the application server (Tomcat) needs to access the proxy or the application server, so the full CA chain has to be trusted. If for testing purposes SSL certificate is self signed, it has to be imported at jre level in a similar way:\necho -n | openssl s_client -connect \u0026lt;jira|confluence_FQDN\u0026gt;:443 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' \u0026gt; /tmp/\u0026lt;jira|confluence_FQDN\u0026gt;.cert cd /opt/atlassian/\u0026lt;confluence|jira\u0026gt;/jre/bin ./keytool -keystore ../lib/security/cacerts -import -alias jira -file /tmp/\u0026lt;jira|confluence_FQDN\u0026gt;.cert  HTTP Configuration Examples  HTTP - direct connection   HTTP - proxy on different server   HTTP - proxy on same server   HTTP - data center  HTTP - direct connection Client connects (http) directly to tomcat (Atlassian service), no extra configuration is required.

    "content": " Adding UI Controls To add UI controls to your mockup, double-click or drag a control in the UI Library or type a keyword into the Quick Add tool.\nYou can also duplicate controls already on the canvas using copy and paste or the duplicate command (CTRL/CMD + D). ALT/Option + drag will also duplicate controls and allow you to place them using your mouse.\nNote: Full list of keyboard shortcuts here. Selecting UI Controls There are a few different ways to select UI controls. If you are familiar with graphics software, these should be of no surprise.\n Clicking on a UI control selects it Dragging a rectangle which encloses many UI controls selects them SHIFT + CLICK on a control adds it to the selection CTRL/CMD + CLICK on a selected control removes it from the selection Hold ALT to ignore items behind the mouse and drag-select  To select a control that is behind another control, right-click on the top control to bring up a menu that allows you to select controls behind it.\nNote: To see this and the other techniques in this article demonstrated in a video, see this tutorial on Tips for Working with Controls. Moving UI Controls Once you have selected one or more UI controls, there are a few different ways to move it on the canvas.\n You can drag it with your mouse (hold down the SHIFT key to maintain the original horizontal or vertical position) You can \u0026ldquo;nudge it\u0026rdquo; one pixel at a time with your keyboard\u0026rsquo;s UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT keys You can move it with bigger steps (10 pixels) by holding down SHIFT and using your keyboard\u0026rsquo;s UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT keys You can move controls to be aligned in one direction by using the align tools shown below  Snapping and Smart Guides When you move objects on the canvas, the editor tries to suggest alignment relative to other objects on the canvas using smart guides. This makes alignment a little easier and makes your wireframes generally look neater.\nIf you ever want to temporarily disable this feature, you can hold down the CTRL/CMD key while moving or resizing, and snapping will be turned off.\nResizing UI Controls Resizing the selected controls is easy. You can just grab any edge or corner of the selection rectangle and drag it.\nIf you want to constrain proportions while dragging from a corner, hold the SHIFT key while dragging.\nYou can also use the keyboard to resize selected controls. CTRL/CMD+ALT+arrow keys to resize in 1px increments, CTRL/CMD+ALT+SHIFT+arrow keys for 10px increments.\nAnother way to resize some controls to their \u0026ldquo;natural size\u0026rdquo; is to use the Auto-Size function found in the Property Inspector.\nTo resize one or more controls to match the size of another (to be the same width or height), you can use the \u0026ldquo;Resize To\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; function in the Edit menu.\nSelect multiple controls and use this option to size all the selected controls to match the narrowest, widest, shortest, or tallest control in the selection.\nAligning UI Controls You can align and distribute (space out) controls by selecting multiple controls and right-clicking to bring up the menu shown below.\nThe same options are shown in the property inspector when multiple controls are selected.\nLayering UI Controls You can layer controls as if they were pieces of paper on the mockup canvas. To do so, you select the controls you want to layer and select one of four layering commands available via the right-click menu or Property Inspector: Bring to Front, Bring Forward, Send Backward, and Send to Back. Keyboard shortcuts are also available.\nLocking UI Controls Locking a control will prevent it from being selectable. This can be useful for background controls that you want to stay in place or don\u0026rsquo;t want to accidentally select (a browser or iPhone control, for example). You can lock a control by selecting it and choosing \u0026ldquo;Lock (control name)\u0026rdquo; from the context menu, or by clicking the lock icon in the toolbar.\nTo unlock a control, right-click on it when your mouse cursor is over it.\nDeleting UI Controls To remove some UI controls from the mockup canvas, select them and hit the DELETE key. Alternatively you can click on the trashcan icon in the toolbar or select \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo; from the Edit menu.\nRotating UI Controls Some of the UI controls can be rotated via the Property Inspector (the label, image, and icon controls, for example), but many can\u0026rsquo;t. If you are used to generic drawing tools this might be surprising. This limitation is intentional, and not due to programming complexity (it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to add technically).\nThe reason we don\u0026rsquo;t support rotating all controls because we believe that in 90% of cases, it is not needed in wireframes. In fact, adding the ability to rotate any control will likely result in wireframes that are very hard if not impossible to implement by the development team.\nIf you feel that you need to rotate any other control, let us know on this forum thread and we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss whether to add it together. A workaround would be to rotate a control in a drawing application and then import it as an image.\nGrouping UI Controls Sometimes you might want to group some controls to better align them or move them all at once. To group a set of controls, select them and hit CTRL/CMD + G on your keyboard or use the Group command in the Edit menu or toolbar. The controls will change color to purple to indicate that they are grouped. Once grouped, the controls will behave as one when moving or aligning. To ungroup controls, press CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + G on your keyboard or use the Ungroup command in the menu or toolbar.\nYou can double-click on a group to \u0026ldquo;enter it\u0026rdquo; and edit its contents. A small floating breadcrumb bar will indicate that you are editing a group and allow you to navigate back out of the group (you can also use the Escape key). Groups can be nested, as shown below.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a video that shows grouping in action:\n You can give a group a name via the Property Inspector. This can be helpful when you have a lot of groups and need to \u0026ldquo;know where you are\u0026rdquo; when you edit their contents. Naming groups is also useful when creating Symbols.\nCropping Groups It is possible to crop (mask) a group of controls to only show a selected portion of it. When a group is selected, a crop icon will show in the Property Inspector. Click on it to edit the visible area of the group.\nThe video below illustrates how to use this feature.\n Note: To crop a single control, select it and group it (yes, a group with only one element). You will then be able to crop it. \u0026ldquo;Drawing\u0026rdquo; Basic Controls There are three controls that you can add to the canvas by \u0026ldquo;drawing\u0026rdquo; them with your mouse while holding down a letter key. To quickly draw a rectangle on the canvas, hold down the R key and drag your mouse. Holding down T instead will draw a block of text, and Y will produce a line of text.\nSee the video below for a demonstration.\n After you\u0026rsquo;ve added these controls, you can easily convert them to other controls by using the transform menu.\n"

    "description": "",
    "content": " Alternates (also sometimes referred to as versions or branches) allow you to create variations on a single wireframe design without adding more wireframes to your project.\nCreating alternates can be useful during the early design phase when exploring concepts and in later stages for reviewers to add their feedback and propose changes.\nSome possible reasons for using alternates:\n You want to create only one wireframe per screen but have several ideas about each one. You want suggestions for design improvements but don\u0026rsquo;t want other people changing your wireframes. You want to send your project around for feedback and track each person\u0026rsquo;s feedback individually. You want to try out new design ideas without including them in the wireframes for the current release.  Here\u0026rsquo;s an overview:\n Creating Alternates When viewing a wireframe without any controls selected you will see a section of the Property Inspector panel called \u0026ldquo;Alternate Versions\u0026rdquo; below the notes for that wireframe.\nTo create a new alternate click the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; (plus) icon next to \u0026ldquo;Alternate Versions\u0026rdquo;\nor use the context menu in the Navigator panel.\nThis will create a copy of the current wireframe as an alternate version for you to modify. By default it will automatically be named with the word \u0026ldquo;Alternate\u0026rdquo; followed by some random numbers and letters to ensure that the name is unique.\nThe selection in the alternate versions list tells you which version of the wireframe you are working on. You can create as many alternates as you\u0026rsquo;d like.\nNote: You can create an alternate of an alternate. Clicking the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; (plus) icon when an alternate is selected creates an alternate of the selected version rather than the official version. When an alternate exists an icon will appear next to the name in the Navigator panel indicating that there are alternates. When you are working on an alternate version the Navigator panel will show the alternate name in parentheses.\nTo rename the alternate double-click on the name in the alternates versions list or use the context or right-click menu and select \u0026ldquo;Rename\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nEditing Alternates Once you have created an alternate version you can edit it just like any other wireframe, including adding assets and symbols. Changes that you make will not affect the original wireframe (shown as the Official Version). You can also add notes in the notes panel for the alternate to describe your thoughts on it or communicate to others about it.\nTo switch between alternate versions of a wireframe select the name of a version from the list in the properties panel or from the context menu in the Navigator panel. You may also switch back to the Official Version by selecting it in the list.\nNote: If you link to a wireframe that contains an alternate the link will go to the version of the wireframe that is selected in the alternates list. The same rule applies to exporting. The selected versions of your wireframes will be exported. Promoting Alternates If you decide that you like one alternate better than the original wireframe you can \u0026ldquo;promote\u0026rdquo; it to the official version, which replaces and overwrites the original.\nNote: You can undo this action by using the undo command (CTRL/CMD+Z) three times. The alternate that was promoted is retained in case you want to preserve it as part of the change history. Otherwise you can discard it.\nDuplicating Alternates You can duplicate wireframes from the contextual menu. Doing this will create a new, randomly named alternate that is an exact copy of the alternate you chose to duplicate.\nSometimes, however, an alternate grows into a wireframe all its own. If you would like to create a whole new wireframe based on an alternate, you can choose the \u0026ldquo;Duplicate As New Wireframe\u0026rdquo; option from the contextual menu.\nThe new wireframe will be named using the Name of the Alternate and then the Name of the Original Wireframe. So if you had an alternate named \u0026ldquo;Rotated Header\u0026rdquo;, in your \u0026ldquo;Homepage\u0026rdquo; wireframe, the wireframe created from the alternate would be named \u0026ldquo;Rotated Header Homepage\u0026rdquo;.\nMerging Alternates If you want to combine parts of an alternate with the official version, you can use the merge option.\nSelecting \u0026ldquo;Merge with Official\u0026rdquo; will add the contents of the selected version to the official version, to the right of the wireframe contents, as shown below.\nIf the notes in the alternate are different than the notes in the original, they will also be merged, separated by a dashed horizontal line.\nYou can then manually edit the contents to create a new official version that is a combination of the preferred elements of each version.\nDiscarding Alternates When you have finished reviewing or integrating alternate versions into an official version you can delete alternates you no longer want using the \u0026ldquo;Discard\u0026rdquo; option.\nNote: Alternates cannot be recovered after they have been discarded. Alternates in Full Screen Presentation Mode You can view your alternates in Full Screen Presentation Mode by using the navigator dropdown.\nWhen you select a wireframe alternate in this view, its name will show up in parentheses next to the official wireframe name.\nProject Alternates In some cases you might want to propose a set of alternate designs across several wireframes. This might happen if you are reviewing someone else\u0026rsquo;s wireframes and want them to see your proposed design changes throughout the project.\nWhen you rename an alternate you can choose from a list of existing alternate names in the rename dialog. This makes it easy to use the same alternate name in several wireframes.\nIn the Navigator panel next to the word Wireframes a menu shows the names of all alternates that appear in your project.\nSelecting an alternate from this list will select that alternate in all the wireframes that have an alternate with that name.\nNote: This is conceptually similar to creating a branch in a codebase, except that it only applies to wireframes that have specific alternate version names. So, for example, if you create a series of alternates called \u0026ldquo;Leon\u0026rsquo;s Proposal\u0026rdquo; and use the context menu shown above to select that name, any wireframe with an alternate called \u0026ldquo;Leon\u0026rsquo;s Proposal\u0026rdquo; would switch views to that alternate version.\nWireframes without an alternate with that name would not be updated. Promoting, merging, and discarding actions are not available across multiple wireframes at once.\n"

    "title": "Balsamiq Mockups 3 Application Overview",
    "tags": [],
    "description": "",
    "content": " Balsamiq Mockups is a user interface design tool for creating wireframes (also called mockups or low-fidelity prototypes). You can use it to generate digital sketches of your product ideas to facilitate discussion and understanding before any code is written.\nEach Balsamiq Mockups file (with a .bmpr file extension) represents one project and can contain many mockups and images, which are stored together in a single .bmpr file. Mockups for different projects should be created in separate Balsamiq Mockups files. To create a new project select Project \u0026gt; New Project from the menu.\nNote: Single project files are new in Balsamiq Mockups 3. The Balsamiq Mockups user interface is made up of five primary areas: the toolbar, the UI Library, the canvas, the navigator panel and the properties panel. Each is described below.\nNote: You can watch a video covering basic usage of the application in our Mockups Intro Video tutorial. The Toolbar The toolbar contains a series of icons for performing actions on other areas of the user interface.\nThe first set of icons is described below.\n Navigate between Mockups, Assets, Symbols and Trash Show/Hide the left panel View your mockups as a thumbnail grid Create a new mockup Mockup actions (rename, etc.) and navigate between mockups (shown when left panel is hidden) Go to next or previous mockup (shown when left panel is hidden)  The group of icons in the center of the toolbar is for commonly-performed canvas functions. These are actions that you are probably used to from text editors or other drawing tools, such as copy, paste, group, align and zoom. The last icon is for toggling markup (read about markup here).\nThe final section of the toolbar on the far right contains the Quick Add tool, toggle icons for the UI Library, Property Inspector and Project Info Panel, and an icon to enter Full Screen Presentation Mode. The top of the toolbar shows the name of the project, which you can double-click to rename (or go to Project \u0026gt; Rename Project\u0026hellip; in the menu).\nThe Quick Add Tool The Quick Add tool is the fastest way to add UI controls to your mockup. To use quick add, click inside the quick add input box (or use the / or + keyboard shortcut to enter it). Type a few letters from the name of a UI control or icon and Quick Add will show you a list of suggestions. Use your mouse or arrow keys to scroll down the list and click or press Enter to add the control or icon on the mockup canvas. You can also use Shift + Enter to place the control where your mouse cursor is on the canvas.\nFor example, typing \u0026ldquo;bu\u0026rdquo; shows a list containing \u0026ldquo;Button\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Button Bar\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Help Button\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Radio Button\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Round Button\u0026rdquo;. Typing \u0026ldquo;hel\u0026rdquo;, on the other hand, only returns \u0026ldquo;Help Button\u0026rdquo;. Pressing the ESCape key makes the list disappear, as one would expect.\nTry out Quick Add now! As you become familiar with it, you could even hide the UI Library and simply use Quick Add to add UI elements to your mockup. This maximizes both your mockup canvas area and your speed!\nThe UI Library The UI Library, or UI controls Library, is the long strip of UI controls just below the toolbar. It lists all of the UI control types that come with Mockups as well as Assets, Icons, and Symbols. The main goal of the UI Library is to let you add UI controls to the mockup canvas, but you can also use it to see what\u0026rsquo;s possible and to get inspiration for your UI mockup.\nTo add a new UI control to the canvas, select the control type you wish to add then either drag it to the mockup canvas below or simply double-click and Balsamiq Mockups will place it on the mockup canvas for you.\nThe UI Library can be toggled on and off in several ways: clicking the icon to the right of the Quick Add box, using the keyboard shortcut CTRL/CMD+L, or by selecting View \u0026gt; UI Library from the application menu.\nThe Mockup Canvas This is the main working area of Balsamiq Mockups, where your UI mockup comes to life. Once you add UI controls to it, you can move them, resize them and tweak them to your heart\u0026rsquo;s content until your UI mockup is ready. See Working with UI Controls to learn more.\nThe mockup canvas grows and shrinks with your application window, so you can make room for bigger mockups if you need to.\nNote: If you are working on a small screen or have very large mockups you might want to read this article on hiding the panels to make more room for the canvas. The Navigator Panel The navigator panel on the left shows the list of mockups, assets or Symbols in your project. The currently selected object is highlighted. You can select multiple objects in the navigator panel by holding down the Control or Shift key and clicking on them. Mockups and assets can be viewed as a text-only list or as thumbnail previews.\nYou can hide the navigator panel by clicking the navigator toggle icon above the panel (keyboard shortcut: CTRL/CMD + J). Hiding it will show additional icons in the toolbar (shown above) for navigating between mockups or assets (depending on which one is selected). The panel can be resized by placing your mouse cursor over the line separating the navigator panel from the canvas and dragging left or right. You can double-click on the separator line to reset it to the default width.\nYou can move between mockups or assets using your keyboard via CTRL+Tab or by clicking on one in the navigator and using the up and down arrow keys.\nMockups can be reordered by dragging them up and down in the navigator panel. This can be useful when exporting to PDF, for example. The order of your mockups will be remembered when you close and reopen your project, even if opened on a different computer.\nUsing Mockup Hierarchy Mockups 3 for editor/b3 also offers a hierarchical structure to better organize your mockups.\nTo use it, select the mockup you wish to be the child and press the Tab key. The child mockup will be placed in a tree hierarchy below the mockup above it.\nYou can then use the arrows to the left of the parent mockup to show and hide the mockups under it.\nTo restore it to the top level, use Shift+Tab. The video below shows nesting mockups in action.\n Context Menu Actions A context menu is also available for the objects that are open in the navigator panel. You can either right-click on the selected object or click the small arrow that appears when you hover over it to open the menu.\nThe contents of this menu vary depending on which type of object is selected (mockup, asset, symbol, or trash) but it generally contains options such as rename, move to trash, and duplicate. In the Mockups view it also contains actions for working with alternates.\nRenaming Mockups Renaming mockups can be done via the context menu or by double-clicking on the name of the mockup in the navigator panel. Mockups with links will automatically be updated when a linked mockup name changes.\nThe Properties Panel The panel on the right side of the application (when shown) displays properties for the selected control or object. Depending on which icon is selected it shows either the Property Inspector or Project Info Panel. It can be hidden by de-selecting both panel icons in the toolbar or unchecking Inspector and Project Information in the View menu.\nThumbnail Grid View Clicking the icon to the right of the navigator panel toggle will switch to thumbnail grid view, shown here.\nThis view shows thumbnails of all of your mockups and is useful for getting an overview of your project. It allows you to see more of your mockups at once and is a good view to use for reordering and tidying up (e.g., renaming and moving to the trash). You can trash multiple mockups at once by selecting them (using CTRL/Shift + click) and bringing up the context menu.\nThumbnail grid view is available when viewing mockups and assets, and is the only view available for trash.\nTrash Balsamiq Mockups 3 has a trash for mockups, assets, and Symbols you have deleted. This makes it easy to keep your project tidy as you make progress but still allows you to browse or recover earlier concepts.\nTo recover a trashed object from the Trash panel click the context menu arrow and select \u0026ldquo;Restore.\u0026rdquo; You also have the option to delete permanently.\n"

    "description": "",
    "content": " Thank you for trying out our latest version of Balsamiq Mockups! We think that you\u0026rsquo;ll really like all of the improvements and find it easier to use. To learn more about the new features you can read the Introduction to Balsamiq Mockups 3 or dive into our complete documentation.\nThis article is intended to answer some questions you might have about switching to Balsamiq Mockups 3 from a previous version.\nIs It a Free Update? Yes! And it uses the same license as the old version, so you won\u0026rsquo;t even have to re-register. You will be eligible for any 3.x updates for as long as your subscription or license is valid.\nNote: Mockups 3 for Desktop licenses will cover all 3.x updates My BMMLs Won\u0026rsquo;t Open, What Gives? If you are transitioning from version 2 to version 3 of Balsamiq Mockups the most important thing to know is that Balsamiq Mockups 3 uses a new file format. We made this change to greatly simplify organizing your mockups into projects and to make it much easier to share files.\nIn previous versions each mockup was a separate file and images and Symbols needed to be stored in a specific subfolder in order to be recognized. This made it very confusing when working with lots of mockups, many images or multiple projects.\nNo longer. Our new file format, BMPR (or, \u0026ldquo;bumper\u0026rdquo;), contains all the mockups from one project in a single file, as well as all its images and Symbols. Everything stays together in one place, even if you move the file around. This also means the same project file can be opened in any Mockups 3 product.\nFor our existing customers this means that you will need to import your existing files to Balsamiq Mockups 3 for them to work. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, we made it very easy.\nThere are several options for importing, from bringing in entire projects to importing individual mockups or Symbol Libraries. Just go to the Project \u0026gt; Import menu, as shown below.\nSee this page for more detailed instructions.\nWe have two recommendations if you want to switch to Balsamiq Mockups 3 but have active projects in BMML format:\n Use versions 2.2 and 3 side-by-side. The application names are different so you can run both versions together. For continuity you might want to finish any existing projects in version 2 and start new projects in version 3. Switch fully to version 3. Import all of your active projects to new Balsamiq Mockups 3 projects and stop using version 2 completely. Going back and forth is going to be a pain since you\u0026rsquo;ll be exporting and importing frequently.  Imported mockups should look the same as they did in your previous version, except that our old icons have been replaced with Font Awesome icons (which you might like better anyway).\nWhat about Your Other Products - myBalsamiq and Atlassian Server Add-Ons? Our new file format and user interface is coming to all of our products soon. In the meantime, you can import and export ZIP files or individual BMMLs, but you might just want to wait until BMPR comes to your other Balsamiq product. Everything will all work seamlessly soon - thanks for your patience.\nHow Do I Use Symbols from Mockups to Go in Balsamiq Mockups 3? There is an option in the Import menu for importing Symbol Libraries. See here for details.\nWhere Are the Old Icons? Can I Still Use Them? We replaced them with the Font Awesome icon set, which has more icons and is more current.\nNostalgic for the old ones? You can download them here:\n Balsamiq Mockups version 2 icon set - Sketch skin (.zip file, 268 Kb) Balsamiq Mockups version 2 icon set - Wireframe skin (.zip file, 234 Kb)  See these instructions for adding them as custom icons.\n"

    "tags": [],
    "description": "",
    "content": " Once you\u0026rsquo;ve added controls to the editor canvas you can edit them by typing directly into them and by changing their properties in the properties panel on the right. Both will be described below.\nEditing Properties via the Property Inspector The Property Inspector is a panel on the right side of the application that allows you to set some common properties such as alignment, position and size as well as settings specific to certain controls (selection state, text properties, color, etc.). It is available when viewing wireframes, assets, and Symbols.\nYou can show and hide the Property Inspector by clicking the toggle icon above it (keyboard shortcut CTRL/CMD + ; or ALT/Option + Enter). When hidden you can also show it by right-clicking a control and selecting \u0026ldquo;Properties\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;.\nIf you have multiple controls selected it will show properties that are common to all selected controls as well as options for aligning and distributing.\nCustomizing Controls via Text Many UI controls, such as Button, Label or DataGrid, have text in them. To edit the text, double-click on the control and start typing. Or, if you have the control selected, simply hit Enter or F2 to start editing. To commit the text you typed, simply click anywhere other than the text field you typed in or hit Enter or CTRL+Enter. If you want to discard the text changes you just made, hit the ESC key.\nSome controls use certain characters as separators. For instance, to create multiple tabs in a tabs bar, you separate them with a comma.\nOr, a space character separates tags in a Tag Cloud control. Some other controls, like the Tree Pane, use other characters altogether. In such cases the default text for the control includes explanations on how to use it.\nWhen editing text in a Label or Paragraph control you will see a small number in the lower-right corner of the editing box. This is the number of characters, which can be useful for copywriting or other purposes.\nBasic Formatting Text Style You can use the following notation to format only certain parts of your control\u0026rsquo;s text.\n for italic, use _this notation_ for a link, use [this notation] for bold, use *this notation* for disabled, use -this notation- for underlined, use \u0026amp;this notation\u0026amp; for strikethrough, use ~this notation~ for color, use {color:#FF0000}this notation{color}. for font size, use {size:16}this notation{size}  All of the above syntax works around words separated by white spaces, and underline will work within words.\nNotes:\n1. The #FF0000 above is the color in HEX form, just like HTML. The macro will work with or without the pound sign. You can also use certain color names (green, yellow, etc.) which you can find by moving your mouse over the colors in the color palette in the Property Inspector.\n2. See the next section for how to turn [linked text] into functioning links to websites or other wireframes.\n3. This formatting syntax also works for text entered into the Notes panel except italic and strikethrough.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a screenshot of what the above text looks like in a Paragraph control, for instance:\nThe shortcuts will work almost everywhere where it makes sense, and you can combine them, so to make an italic link use [_this_] or _[this]_.\nSome controls like Paragraph or Label allow you to \u0026ldquo;unbold\u0026rdquo; the text via the Property Inspector panel. If you do so, the words you *bolded* will stay bold. A few controls use bold text by default, so bolding text within those controls won\u0026rsquo;t make a difference.\nIf you want to show these special formatting characters as actual text, you can escape the *, _, -, [ and ] characters with \\*, \\_, \\-, \\[ and \\], so if you want to write \u0026ldquo;this [is] some text\u0026rdquo; and don\u0026rsquo;t want the \u0026ldquo;is\u0026rdquo; to become a link, just type \u0026ldquo;this \\[is\\] some text\u0026rdquo;.\nLine Breaks Most controls allow you to insert a line break to wrap text from one line to the next. You can do this by writing \\r in front of the text you want to start on a new line. See the example below where a line break is used in the second item in a Radio Button control.\nBulleted Lists In a paragraph control, you can create a bulleted list by preceding text with either a hyphen or an asterisk followed by a space.\n* item 1 * item 2 - item 3 - item 4  Making Links in Text Actually Work If you are using the link notation above (e.g., [this is a link]), you can turn link-formatted text into actual links using markdown syntax.\nTo do this, add the link destination in parentheses immediately after the link text. The link destination can be a URL or the name of another mockup in the same folder. All the following formats are valid.\nWeb addresses:\n[Balsamiq Website](balsamiq.com) [Balsamiq Website](www.balsamiq.com) [Balsamiq Website](http://www.balsamiq.com) [Balsamiq Website](https://balsamiq.com)  Wireframes in the same project:\n[Features Page](features)  Adding links in this way will cause them to show up in the Property Inspector as well, as shown below.\nThis text\nresults in\nYou can link specific strings of text as well as the whole control.\nNote: If the whole control is linked, text links will be disabled. If the whole control is subsequently unlinked, the previous text links will return. More Macros Lorem Type lorem in a Paragraph or Text Area to use our Lorem Ipsum generator.\n{Mockup-Name} Type {mockup-name} (all lower-case) in a Label, Text, Title or Subtitle control to show the current mockup name.\nPlaceholder Text Another option for creating placeholder text, besides the Lorem Ipsum text generator, is to use the Line of Text and Block of Text controls in the UI Library.\nNote: Read about drawing these controls directly on the canvas to learn how to add them really quickly. You can convert them to real text at any time by editing them and entering some text or simply by double-clicking each control, as shown below.\nTransforming Control Types Many controls can be converted into other controls. This can be useful when you already have content in your wireframes but want to use a different control type without re-typing the content (changing a text input to a combo box, for example).\nJust click on a control and open the context menu next to the control name in the Property Inspector to see which control types the selected control can be transformed to. Select the control you want to convert it to or use the search to look for it.\nYou can transform controls quickly using the shortcut CTRL+T to bring up the transform menu in the center of the canvas.\nSee the video below for a demonstration.\n Advanced Controls (Data Grid, Sitemap, Tree Pane) Some controls have more powerful text editing capabilities that are worth describing in more detail.\nThe Data Grid (Table) Control The Data Grid control functions like many other text-based controls. It uses commas as column separators and new lines as rows. A basic table with three columns and two rows would look like this:\nFirst Name, Last Name, Email Address firstname, lastname, email@email.com  You can choose whether to show the first row as a header row in the Property Inspector, as well as specifying the row height, row colors, and grid lines.\nText in the Data Grid can be formatted as bold, italic, etc. using the same syntax as other text controls.\nColumn Width Options Balsamiq Wireframes lets you specify individual width and alignment options for each Data Grid column.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a quick video showing how to do this:\n Here are the details for creating column widths:\n You have to add a special line of text as the last line of text in your table, and it has to be wrapped by { } curly brackets For each column, use 0 if you want the column to be as small as possible to fit the text in that column, or a number Numbers specify the relative size of columns, so {2,1} means \u0026ldquo;make the first column twice as big as the second one in this two-column\ngrid. Or {70,20,10} means \u0026ldquo;in this 3-column grid, make the 1st column 70%, the 2nd 20% and the 3rd 10% of the width of the whole table. You can combine numbers and zeros, e.g., {1,0,4} If you want to align column individually, add either L, C or R right after a number, like so: {0R,2L,1}, which means \u0026ldquo;in this 3 column grid, make the 1st column as small as possible and always align it to the right, the second twice as big as the third and always align it left, and use the Data Grid\u0026rsquo;s alignment (from the property inspector) to decide how to align the 3rd column\u0026rdquo;.  Using Icons and Selection Controls in a Data Grid Data Grid supports sort icons in headers using the following text:\n Ascending: ^ Descending: v  Data Grids support a single checkbox or radio button in a table cell using the following text:\n Checkbox: [] or [ ] Selected checkbox: [x] or [v] or [o] or [*] or [X] or [V] or [O] Indeterminate checkbox: [-] Radio button: () or ( ) Selected radio button: (x) or (v) or (o) or (*) or (X) or (V) or (O) Indeterminate radio button: (-)  Creating Line Returns in a Data Grid Sometimes you want to create line returns in a table cell. To do this, you can use \u0026ldquo;\\r\u0026rdquo; to create a line return.\nThe code example below would print on two lines.\nName\\r(job title)  Pasting Data from Excel Some people like to prepare tables in a spreadsheet application like Excel. You can copy and paste a range of cells directly from Excel into the Data Grid/Table component. Just copy/paste and it will just work. It also works in the opposite direction from Balsamiq Wireframes to Excel.\nNote: If you have commas in your cells, you will have to escape them with a backslash like this: 1\\,000\\,000 The component recognizes both commas and tabs as delimiters. Anything else should be populated into cells.\nYou can create simple site maps from a text outline using the Site Map control.\nThe Site Map Control Edit the Site Map control by double-clicking or selecting it and pressing the Enter key. Edit the outline to create parent-child relationships. Each line represents a box (or page/node) in your sitemap. Use hyphens to indent child boxes beneath a parent. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example:\nHome - Products -- Product 1 -- Product 2 - About Us\\rCompany - Support - Blog  Using the Property Inspector you can add links to the nodes in the map and change the text properties and orientation of the map (vertical or horizontal).\nThis is what the outline above looks like in vertical orientation (default):\n\u0026hellip;and in horizontal orientation:\nGenerating Site Maps Automatically Next to the options for changing the orientation in the Property Inspector is a button that allows you to automatically populate a site map based on the order and structure of your wireframes in the Navigator Panel.\nEach time you click the \u0026ldquo;Populate from Project\u0026rdquo; project the site map will be updated to reflect the current project structure.\nIf you are using a parent-child hierarchy, child wireframes will be shown as child nodes in the site map, as shown below.\nLinks will be added to each node in the site map to the corresponding wireframe in your project.\nNotes and Options  Single Tree Support: Site Map expects the first line to be the top-most parent, and only one of these can exist because it only makes a single tree. If you want to make multiple trees, just add more Site Map controls. Multi-Line Text: You can use \\r to create line returns on text in a box like this: About\\rUs You can\u0026rsquo;t resize Site Maps, but if you are unable to view the entire map on your canvas you can try changing the orientation or showing one of the nodes expanded in a separate Site Map, as shown below.  The Tree Pane The Tree Pane control allows you to create a hierarchical list of objects, similar to what you would see in a file explorer or vertical navigation panel.\nYou can show common icons next to items in the list, such as folders, files, and other types of expand/collapse symbols.\nDouble-click to edit the text and you will see how to use it (\u0026ldquo;f\u0026rdquo; for closed folder, \u0026ldquo;F\u0026rdquo; for open folder, etc.).\nNote: Make sure to add a space between the icon indicator and the text after it (.e.g., \u0026ldquo;F folder name\u0026rdquo;, not \u0026ldquo;Ffolder name\u0026rdquo;). To indent items use a space or dot (\u0026ldquo;.\u0026rdquo;) for each level in the hierarchy you want to indent to.\n"

    "description": "",
    "content": " The Balsamiq Wireframes editor interface is made up of five primary areas: the toolbar, the UI Library, the canvas, the navigator panel and the properties panel. Each is described below.\nThe Toolbar The toolbar contains a series of icons for performing actions on other areas of the user interface.\nThe first set of icons is described below.\n Show/Hide the left panel View your wireframes as a thumbnail grid Create a new wireframe Wireframe actions (rename, etc.) and navigate between wireframes (shown when left panel is hidden) Go to next or previous wireframe (shown when left panel is hidden)  The group of icons in the center of the toolbar is for commonly-performed canvas functions. These are actions that you are probably used to from text editors or other drawing tools, such as copy, paste, group, align and zoom. The last icon is for toggling markup (read about markup here).\nThe final section of the toolbar on the far right contains the Quick Add tool, toggle icons for the UI Library, Comments Panel Property Inspector and Project Info Panel, and an icon to enter Full Screen Presentation Mode. The top of the toolbar shows the name of the project, which you can double-click to rename (or go to Project \u0026gt; Rename Project\u0026hellip; in the menu).\nThe Quick Add Tool The Quick Add tool is the fastest way to add UI controls to your wireframes. To use quick add, click inside the quick add input box (or use the \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; keyboard shortcut to enter it).\nType a few letters from the name of a UI control or icon and Quick Add will show you a list of suggestions. Use your mouse or arrow keys to scroll down the list and click or press Enter to add the control or icon on the canvas. You can also use Shift + Enter to place the control where your mouse cursor is on the canvas.\nFor example, typing \u0026ldquo;bu\u0026rdquo; shows a list containing \u0026ldquo;Button\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Button Bar\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Help Button\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Radio Button\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Round Button\u0026rdquo;. Typing \u0026ldquo;hel\u0026rdquo;, on the other hand, only returns \u0026ldquo;Help Button\u0026rdquo;. Pressing the ESCape key makes the list disappear.\nTip: As you become familiar with quick add, you can hide the UI Library and only use quick add to add UI elements to your wireframes. This maximizes both your canvas area and your speed. The UI Library The UI Library, or User Interface controls Library, is the long strip of user interface controls just below the toolbar. It lists all of the UI control types that are included as well as Assets, Icons, and Symbols. The main goal of the UI Library is to let you add UI controls to the canvas, but you can also use it to see what\u0026rsquo;s possible and to get inspiration for your wireframes.\nTo add a new UI control to the canvas, select the control type you wish to add then either drag it to the canvas below or simply double-click and it will be placed on the canvas for you.\nThe UI Library can be toggled on and off in several ways: clicking the icon to the right of the Quick Add box, using the keyboard shortcut CTRL/CMD+L, or by selecting View \u0026gt; UI Library from the application menu.\nThe Canvas This is the main working area of the editor, where your UI wireframe comes to life. Once you add UI controls to it, you can move them, resize them and tweak them until your UI wireframe is ready. See Adding and Arranging UI Controls to learn more.\nThe canvas grows and shrinks with your application window, so you can make room for bigger wireframes if you need to.\nNote: If you are working on a small screen or have very large wireframes you might want to read this article on hiding the panels to make more room for the canvas. The Navigator Panel The navigator panel on the left shows the list of wireframes, assets or Symbols in your project. The currently selected object is highlighted. You can select multiple objects in the navigator panel by holding down the Control or Shift key and clicking on them. Wireframes and assets can be viewed as a text-only list or as thumbnail previews.\nYou can hide the navigator panel by clicking the navigator toggle icon above the panel (keyboard shortcut: CTRL/CMD + J). Hiding it will show additional icons in the toolbar (shown above) for navigating between wireframes or assets (depending on which one is selected). The panel can be resized by placing your mouse cursor over the line separating the navigator panel from the canvas and dragging left or right. You can double-click on the separator line to reset it to the default width.\nYou can jump between wireframes or assets using your keyboard via CTRL+Tab or by clicking on one in the navigator and using the up and down arrow keys.\nWireframes can be reordered by dragging them up and down in the navigator panel. This can be useful when exporting to PDF, for example. The order of your wireframes will be remembered when you close and reopen your project, even if opened on a different computer.\nUsing a Hierarchy The navigator panel also offers a hierarchical structure to better organize your wireframes.\nTo use it, select the wireframe you wish to be the child and press the Tab key. The child wireframe will be placed in a tree hierarchy below the wireframe above it.\nYou can then use the arrows to the left of the parent wireframe to show and hide the wireframes under it.\nTo restore it to the top level, use Shift+Tab. The video below shows nesting wireframes in action.\n Context Menu Actions A context menu is also available for the objects that are open in the navigator panel. You can either right-click on the selected object or click the small arrow that appears when you hover over it to open the menu.\nThe contents of this menu vary depending on which type of object is selected (wireframe, asset, symbol, or trash) but it generally contains options such as rename, move to trash, and duplicate. In the Wireframes view it also contains actions for working with alternates.\nRenaming Wireframes Renaming wireframes can be done via the context menu or by double-clicking on the name of the wireframe in the navigator panel. Wireframes with links will automatically be updated when a linked wireframe name changes.\nThe Properties Panel The panel on the right side of the application (when shown) displays properties for the selected control or object. Depending on which icon is selected it shows either the Property Inspector, the Project Info Panel, or the Comments Panel. It can be hidden by de-selecting the panel icons in the toolbar or in the View menu.\nThe Property Inspector The Property Inspector allows you to set some common properties for controls, such as alignment, position and size as well as specific settings for certain controls (selection state, text properties, color, etc.). It is available when viewing wireframes, assets, and Symbols.\nYou can show and hide the Property Inspector by clicking the toggle icon above it (keyboard shortcut CTRL/CMD + ; or ALT/Option + Enter). When hidden you can also show it by right-clicking a control and selecting \u0026ldquo;Properties\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;.\nIf you have multiple controls selected it will show properties that are common to all selected controls as well as options for aligning and distributing.\nWhen no controls are selected the Property Inspector shows notes for the selected wireframes, asset, or Symbol. In the wireframes view the panel also shows wireframe alternates.\nNote: You can format notes text using the syntax described here to make text bold, underlined, etc. For assets and Symbols it also shows the count and name of wireframes where the selected object is used.\nThe Project Info Panel The Project Info Panel allows you to define project-wide settings for skin, font, and link and selection color. It also contains an area to add notes about the project. Click the icon to the right of the Property Inspector icon to toggle the Project Info panel (keyboard shortcut: CTRL/CMD + ,).\nThese settings will be applied to all wireframes in the project and will be saved with the project (i.e., they persist when the project is closed and reopened or shared with others).\nThe default font is Balsamiq Sans, just as in previous versions (not Comic Sans as you might think; although you can set it to that, all you Comic Sans lovers out there!).\nNote: If you want to use a specific project font we recommend that you set it before you start creating your wireframes. Changing the project font may adversely affect existing wireframes in your project. Each font has different dimensions and proportions so switching fonts may cause controls to overlap or line up unevenly. Also, setting your project font to a variant such as \u0026ldquo;thin\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;light\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;extrabold\u0026rdquo; may override font style settings on individual controls. Sketch vs Wireframe Skin The two skins provided are intended to allow you to work on early ideas using a rough, sketchy look (Sketch Skin), and then later update it to a crisper, more polished look when it is ready for presentation (Wireframe Skin).\nThe screenshots below show a comparison of a sample design in the default \u0026ldquo;sketch\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;wireframe\u0026rdquo; skins, respectively. Click to view larger images.\n \nComments The Comments Panel allows you to collaborate on your designs by sharing feedback asynchronously or, if you prefer, making notes for yourself as you work.\nComments can be marked as resolved after they are reviewed and addressed. You can add Callout markers to indicate specific places in the wireframe where the comments applies or add a link to an alternate version.\nYou can learn more about comments in Sharing and Reviewing.\nThumbnail Grid View Clicking the icon to the right of the navigator panel toggle will switch to thumbnail grid view, shown here.\nThis view shows thumbnails of all of your wireframes and is useful for getting an overview of your project. It allows you to see more of your wireframes at once and is a good view to use for reordering and tidying up (e.g., renaming and moving to the trash). You can trash multiple wireframes at once by selecting them (using CTRL/Shift + click) and bringing up the context menu.\nThumbnail grid view is available when viewing wireframes and assets, and is the only view available for trash.\nTrash Trash is available for wireframes, assets, and Symbols you have deleted. This makes it easy to keep your project tidy as you make progress, but still allows you to browse or recover earlier concepts.\nTo recover a trashed object from the Trash panel click the context menu arrow and select \u0026ldquo;Restore.\u0026rdquo; You also have the option to delete permanently.\n"

The PDF will be created in high resolution and with selectable text (good for your team to copy/paste from).\nIf your wireframes contain links, these will work in your exported PDF as well, which will allow you to create click-through prototypes of your designs. (To learn more about linking, see Linking wireframes Together.)\nNote: Links may not work in the default Windows 8 or 10 PDF viewer. If this happens, you can download Adobe Acrobat or one of the many other free PDF viewers. To export to PDF select the Project \u0026gt; Export to PDF\u0026hellip; menu command (shortcut: CTRL/CMD+P). Each wireframe will be displayed on a separate page of a PDF document. The wireframes will be in the same order as in the project, so arrange them in the order you\u0026rsquo;d like before exporting.\nYou can choose to export all wireframes or a subset, including any alternates you have created.\nThe PDF export options are shown here.\nExporting to an Image To save one or all of your wireframes as image files choose one of the export to PNG commands from the Export menu:\n Export \u0026gt; Current wireframe to PNG\u0026hellip; will save the selected wireframe in PNG image format Export \u0026gt; All wireframes to PNG\u0026hellip; will save all of the wireframes in your project as separate image files  If you check the \u0026ldquo;Use Transparent Background\u0026rdquo; option, the exported images will be transparent anywhere the canvas shows through in the wireframe.\nThe shortcuts for exporting a wireframe and project to image files are CTRL/CMD+R and CTRL/CMD+Shift+R, respectively. Exporting all wireframes will also generate images for any alternates you have created.\nYou can also export a subset of the controls in your wireframe by selecting them on the canvas and using the Export Current wireframe to PNG command. The export dialog will ask you if you want to export only the selected controls or the entire wireframe.\nPrinting The Balsamiq Wireframes editor does not support printing directly to a printer. Instead you can export to PDF and print from your favorite PDF viewer.\nExporting Wireframes to Another Project Sometimes you might want to copy or move a wireframe from one project to another. Here is a simple way to do it:\n Open the two projects (each in its own browser tab or window) In the source project, select the wireframe you want to copy or move. Select all the controls from this wireframe (CTRL/CMD+A) and copy the controls (CTRL/CMD+C) In the target project, paste your controls (CTRL/CMD+V) in a newly created wireframe  That’s it! You may now delete the wireframe from the source project if you wish.\nNote: Symbols and images won’t get transferred in this process. You will have to manually add them to the target project. Alternatively, you can also use the JSON feature, available in the Export menu:\n Open the two projects In the source project, select the wireframe you want to copy or move. In the Project menu, select Export \u0026gt; Wireframe to JSON\u0026hellip; This will put a text-based representation of the wireframe in the clipboard. In the target project, select Import \u0026gt; Wireframe JSON\u0026hellip; from the Project menu. In the dialog that pops up, paste the content of the clipboard with CTRL/CMD+V and click the Import button.  Exporting to Other Versions of Balsamiq You can easily export a project to another Balsamiq product (using the .bmpr extension) by using the \u0026ldquo;Project \u0026gt; Export \u0026gt; Download Project BMPR\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; option.\n"

You can turn it off to remove everything but the mockup (even the icon will disappear until the cursor is placed over it), this is useful for usability testing when you want a more realistic experience.\nNavigating between Mockups You can navigate between mockups using the icons in the upper left. They behave like the navigation icons in the editor toolbar. The up and down arrows navigate between your mockups in order, while the icon activated below allows you to jump directly to a specific mockup.\nIf you have created mockup alternates, a menu will appear when you mouse over the mockup, allowing you to select and display the alternates. If you are viewing an alternate, its name will appear in parentheses next to the offical mockup name.\nIf you have created links between your mockups, the links will be clickable in full screen presentation mode.\nSettings By default you will also see a big blue arrow pointer in place of the regular mouse cursor. This is useful for presenting your mockups. The pointer will point towards the center of the screen in order to always stay out of the way of your mockup as much as possible.\nYou can turn off the big blue arrow in the full screen settings by clicking the gear icon in the top right to open the settings panel.\nThe settings panel also has an option to turn on and off link hints. When link hints are on areas that contain links will be shown with a pink overlay so they can be seen easily.\nThe Markup setting is for showing and hiding markup elements, such as Sticky Notes, Arrows and Callouts (any control under the \u0026ldquo;Markup\u0026rdquo; tab in the UI Library). This is useful if you want to just look at your UI without the annotations that surround it.\nThe last setting is to set the view to zoom out to fit the largest mockup.

    "content": " The Full Screen Presentation Mode is great for presenting your wireframes to stakeholders or usability testing.\nTo enter it, just click on the full-screen icon in the top-right corner of your toolbar, select \u0026ldquo;Full Screen Presentation\u0026rdquo; from the View menu or simply hit CTRL/CMD+F.\nThe application will expand to take up your whole screen, with your wireframe centered on it.\nThe far left icon toggles the top bar on and off. You can turn it off to remove everything but the wireframe (even the icon will disappear until the cursor is placed over it), this is useful for usability testing when you want a more realistic experience.\nNavigating between Wireframes You can navigate between wireframes using the icons in the upper left. They behave like the navigation icons in the editor toolbar. The up and down arrows navigate between your wireframes in order, while the icon activated below allows you to jump directly to a specific wireframe.\nIf you have created wireframe alternates, a menu will appear when you mouse over the wireframe, allowing you to select and display the alternates. If you are viewing an alternate, its name will appear in parentheses next to the official wireframe name.\nIf you have created links between your wireframes, the links will be clickable in full screen presentation mode.\nSettings By default you will also see a big blue arrow pointer in place of the regular mouse cursor. This is useful for presenting your wireframes. The pointer will point towards the center of the screen in order to always stay out of the way of your wireframe as much as possible.\nYou can turn off the big blue arrow in the full screen settings by clicking the gear icon in the top right to open the settings panel.\nThe settings panel also has an option to turn on and off link hints. When link hints are on areas that contain links will be shown with a pink overlay so they can be seen easily.\nThe Markup setting is for showing and hiding markup elements, such as Sticky Notes, Arrows and Callouts (any control under the \u0026ldquo;Markup\u0026rdquo; tab in the UI Library). This is useful if you want to just look at your UI without the annotations that surround it.\nThe last setting is to set the view to zoom out to fit the largest wireframe. All other wireframes will be zoomed relative to the largest wireframe.\nThere are keyboard shortcuts for each setting, shown next to the setting name in the panel. No modifier key is required in full screen mode (e.g., just L for link hints, not CTRL/CMD+L)\nThe info icon next to the settings icon will open a panel to view and edit notes for the selected wireframe, just like in normal edit mode.\nTo exit Full Screen Presentation mode, hit the ESC key or click the icon in the upper right corner.\nAdjusting Your Project\u0026rsquo;s Centering Full Screen Presentation Mode centers your entire project based on the wireframe that is the tallest, and the wireframe that is the widest.

    "content": " Importing Mockups from a Previous Version (BMML Files) Balsamiq Mockups 3 uses a different file format from previous versions. You can import your old mockups in one of three formats:\n Individual BMML files A folder containing BMML files (with images and Symbols in an assets sub-folder) A ZIP file containing BMML files (with or without images and Symbols in an assets sub-folder)  To convert your existing project folders or ZIP files into BMPR files, open the Project \u0026gt; Import menu.\nSelect what you\u0026rsquo;d like to import and your old files will be imported and a new BMPR file will be created.\nYou can also just drag BMML files into Balsamiq Mockups 3 to import them to the current project.\nImporting Symbols If you have Symbols files created with a previous version of Balsamiq Mockups you can import them into Balsamiq Mockups 3 as Symbols using the Import \u0026gt; BMML Symbol Libraries command. This will convert groups into named Symbols that will appear in the Symbols category of the UI Library.\nImporting Mockups from Another Project The easiest way to move or copy mockups from one project to another is to simply drag a mockup (using the navigator panel) from one project to another project. You can also select and copy controls on the canvas in one project and paste them into the canvas in another project.\nAlternatively you can copy mockups from one project to another using the Import/Export Mockup JSON commands in the Project menu. Exporting to Mockups JSON (Project \u0026gt; Export \u0026gt; Mockup to JSON) will copy the Balsamiq Mockups code for the selected mockup to the clipboard. To create this mockup in a new project switch to it and choose “Import Mockup JSON…” from the Project \u0026gt; Import menu and paste the copied code. Images and Symbols won\u0026rsquo;t be copied, however.\nImporting Images To learn about importing images, see Working with Images.\n"

    "description": "",
    "content": " Balsamiq Mockups 3 is the result of nearly a year of heads-down coding to create the product that our customers have been asking for and the product we wanted for ourselves.\nThe most noticeable changes are the two \u0026ldquo;biggies\u0026rdquo; that people have asked for since the very beginning: Support for projects (bundled files, multiple windows) and getting rid of that \u0026ldquo;floating property thingy\u0026rdquo; (the property inspector).\nBut just as important was the work that was done under the hood to make it faster and smarter and the little tweaks across every part of the experience that we hope will make using it even better.\nIn this article you\u0026rsquo;ll find information about how to update, what\u0026rsquo;s new and, of course, how to import your Mockups 2 BMML files. If you are new to Balsamiq Mockups or want to dive deeper after reading this article you can head over to the documentation table of contents or application overview next.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a quick 5-minute video walkthrough of some of the highlights of version 3.\n How to Update Balsamiq Mockups 3 is the most current version of our powerful editor. If you are using any of our web apps, it will update automatically. If you want to use it on the Desktop, you can grab the latest version from our download page. It\u0026rsquo;s a free update for existing customers, you won\u0026rsquo;t even need to re-register.\nBalsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop will run side-by-side with Balsamiq Mockups 2 for Desktop (as a separate application) so no need to uninstall your current version to use it. See below for how to import Mockups 2 BMML files.\nWhile it has been rigorously tested, if you find any bugs or issues, tell us about it!\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s New in Balsamiq Mockups 3 In a word, lots! Here are the \u0026ldquo;highlights\u0026rdquo; you should know about:\n Projects! A new user interface Easier look and feel customization Better Symbols Better icons Better images and assets Full screen mode Notes Trash Alternates Music???  Projects! Finally. Not only can you have separate windows for different groups of mockups, but all the \u0026ldquo;stuff\u0026rdquo; that belongs to a project (mockups, symbols, images, icons) is in ONE file. This makes it much easier to send and move files and keep everything together.\nA New User Interface Gone is the annoying flying property inspector! Now you have mockups on the left and properties on the right. Simple, predictable and quick. The UI Library is at the top where it\u0026rsquo;s always been but now it\u0026rsquo;s a bit more compact.\nYou can toggle the properties panels and UI Library independently by clicking the icons next to the Quick Add box or via keyboard shortcuts.\nAnd, of course, you can hide all panels using the icons for each panel, getting you into Zen-like wireframing nirvana.\nGetting around and performing common actions is easy with the icons in the toolbar.\n Navigate between Mockups, Assets, Symbols and Trash views Show/Hide the left panel View your mockups as a thumbnail grid Create a new mockup Mockup actions (rename, etc.) and navigate between mockups (shown when left panel is hidden) Go to next or previous mockup (shown when left panel is hidden)  Easier Look and Feel Customization Control over the font used in Mockups has been one of the most-requested features since the very beginning. Custom fonts were previously available using a complicated configuration file, but we now allow you to set a project font in the new Project Info panel. Yes, you can now easily use any font you have installed in your mockups. Rejoice! You can also set a default size for it.\nWe also moved the skin switching options into the new Project Info panel to make them more obvious (many people never knew about our wireframe skin). Finally, the default selection color is also configurable from this new panel.\nBetter Symbols In the previous version, we called Symbols an \u0026ldquo;advanced feature.\u0026rdquo; Well, no longer. Symbols are now for everyone. Symbols allow you to create templates, masters, and other reusable components to save time and ensure consistency. They are especially useful for big projects and custom controls and are central to our Wireframes To Go site.\nYou can now just jump over to the Symbols panel and create a new one from scratch and it will appear in the \u0026ldquo;Symbols\u0026rdquo; tab in the UI Library. You can still create them the old-fashioned way (creating a named group and clicking the \u0026ldquo;Convert To Symbol\u0026rdquo; button).\nWe also now show Symbols as a list inside their Symbol Library, so you can more easily navigate between them and know which Symbol you\u0026rsquo;re editing.\nFinally, we make it much easier to import Symbols. Just click the \u0026ldquo;Import Symbol Library\u0026rdquo; icon and select the file to import.\nBetter Icons Big changes here.\nFirst of all, icons now have their own category in the UI Library so you can drag and drop them just like any other control.\nNot only that, they show up in the Quick Add results, saving you time when searching by name or keyword.\nIcon search results are shown below any UI controls that match the text you enter.\nAnd you\u0026rsquo;ll quickly notice that we have a completely different set of icons than the previous version. We switched our icons over to the incredibly popular Font Awesome icon set. This means that there are now over 500 icons pre-installed.\nBetter Images and Assets There is now a dedicated area for images and other imported assets, accessible from the navigator menu.\nYou can add images to your project without placing them in your mockups first. Click the \u0026ldquo;Import Asset\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; icon to add a file from your computer or the \u0026ldquo;Download Asset\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; icon to add an image from Flickr or the web. Or just drag an image onto the canvas from your computer.\nYou can also delete, rename, replace and download images from the context menu in the panel.\nNew Full Screen Mode The same options are still there but we\u0026rsquo;ve overhauled the experience to make it better for usability testing and presentations. We also got rid of the problem where mockups would \u0026ldquo;jump around\u0026rdquo; in full screen mode.\nNotes When no controls are selected you\u0026rsquo;ll see a place to add notes in the Properties panel. You can add notes for your Project, Mockups, Assets, Symbol Libraries and individual Symbols and they will be saved as part of the project.\nTrash Balsamiq Mockups 3 now has a trash for mockups, assets, and Symbols you have deleted. This makes it easy to keep your project tidy as you make progress but still allows you to browse or recover earlier concepts.\nTo recover a trashed object from the Trash panel click the context menu arrow and select \u0026ldquo;Restore.\u0026rdquo; You also have the option to delete permanently.\nAlternates Alternates (also sometimes referred to as versions or branches) allow you to create variations on a single mockup design without adding more mockups to your project. Read the full documentation here.\nMusic??? Yes, built-in background music to help you get into your creative zone! Check out the blog post for more details.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s not New For the most part, we left experience of adding, arranging and editing controls the same, so it should be familiar if you are coming from the previous version.\nWe hope all these changes are welcome and that Balsamiq Mockups 3 still feels like the application you\u0026rsquo;ve come to know and love, but better! If you have any thoughts or feedback, please let us know!\nImporting Mockups 2 BMML Files Balsamiq Mockups 3 has a new file format to accommodate support for projects but you can easily import your old files.\nTo convert your existing project folders or ZIP files into BMPR files, just head to the Project \u0026gt; Import menu.\nSelect what you\u0026rsquo;d like to import and your old files will be imported and a new BMPR file will be created.\nFeedback Welcome We\u0026rsquo;d love to know what you think of it. If you find any issues or have any comments, please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to shoot us an email or post Balsamiq Forums. We\u0026rsquo;ll see you there!\n"

The screenshot below shows the Markup button panel selected in the UI Library, and markup items on the page.\nToggling Markup on and Off When you\u0026rsquo;re editing your wireframes, you will sometimes want to see what the wireframe looks like with Markup off. You can do this by using the Show/Hide Markup toggle button at the right end of the toolbar.\nThe screenshot below shows the previous page with Markup off.\nMarkup Toggling with Keyboard Shortcuts There are keyboard shortcuts for toggling visibility on and off.\nPress CTRL+K on Windows (CMD+K on Mac) to toggle markup on and off.\nIn Full Screen presentation mode you can just press the \u0026ldquo;M\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;K\u0026rdquo;) key.\nMaking Items Markup and Non-Markup Sometimes you will want Markup items to be treated as non-markup or vice-versa. For example, you could use the iPhone control as a guide for designing a mobile screen, but you might want to hide the iPhone itself when you export it and view it on a mobile device.\nIf you want to make a Markup item Non-Markup, right click on the component and select the \u0026ldquo;Do Not Treat as Markup\u0026rdquo; option in the context menu. This will allow the component to be visible when the Markup visibility toggle is set to on or off.\nYou can use this \u0026ldquo;Treat As Markup / Do Not Treat As Markup\u0026rdquo; feature on any component. If you right-click on a regular component, you can make it behave like Markup by selecting \u0026ldquo;Treat as Markup.\u0026rdquo; It will be hidden when you toggle Markup visibility off.\nThe video below demonstrates this process:\n Exporting Markup to PNG and PDF If you want your Markup components to appear or be hidden in your exported PNG images or your Exported PDF, simply toggle the Markup visibility as shown above, and Export.\n"

    "title": "Mockups Application Overview",
    "tags": [],
    "description": "",
    "content": " Balsamiq Mockups is made up of three major blocks. From top to bottom: the Application Bar, the UI library, and the Mockup Canvas Each is described below.\nThe Application Bar The application bar includes Menus, the Quick Add tool, and the Toolbar. Each is described below.\nThe Menus The Mockups menus should be pretty self-explanatory. The only tricky bit is that the Mockup menu contains different items depending on what version of Balsamiq Mockups you are using. In general, that\u0026rsquo;s where you\u0026rsquo;ll find the About Box and commands related to your mockup as a whole, like saving, exporting to XML or PNG, etc.\nThe Quick Add Tool The Quick Add tool is the fastest way to add UI controls to your mockup. To use quick add, click inside the quick add input box (or use the / or + keyboard shortcut to enter it). Type a few letters from the name of a UI control or icon and Quick Add will show you a list of suggestions. Use your mouse or arrow keys to scroll down the list and click Enter to add the control or icon on the mockup canvas.\nFor example, typing “bu” shows a list containing “Button”, “Button Bar”, “Help Button”, “Radio Button” and “Round Button”. Typing “hel”, on the other hand, only returns “Help Button”. Pressing the ESCape key makes the list disappear, as one would expect.\nTry out Quick Add now! As you become familiar with it, you could even hide the UI Library (through the View menu) and simply use Quick Add to add UI elements to your mockup. This maximizes both your mockup canvas area and your speed!\nThe Toolbar The toolbar includes most of the same commands as the Edit menu: undo, redo, duplicate, cut, copy, paste and delete. Not all versions of Balsamiq Mockups support the same keyboard shortcuts, so the Toolbar gives you a handy way to perform common actions. Notice that you\u0026rsquo;ll find the same commands in the Property Inspector as well.\nThe UI Library The UI Library, or UI Controls Library, is the long strip of UI Controls just below the Application Bar. It lists all of the different UI control types that Mockups supports, alphabetically. The main goal of the UI Library is to let you add UI Controls to the mockup canvas, but you can also use it to see what\u0026rsquo;s possible and to get inspiration for your UI mockup.\nTo add a new UI control to the canvas, simply select the control type you wish to add, then you can either \u0026ldquo;drag and drop\u0026rdquo; it to the mockup canvas below or simply double-click and Balsamiq Mockups will place it on the mockup canvas for you.\nThe UI Library can be positioned to the top, left, or right of the application window using the menu, View \u0026gt; UI Library Position.\nThe Mockup Canvas The rest of the application is the Mockup Canvas.\nThis is the main working area of Balsamiq Mockups, where your UI mockup comes to life. Once you add UI controls to it, you can move them, resize them and tweak them to your heart\u0026rsquo;s content until your UI mockup is ready.\nThe mockup canvas grows and shrinks with your browser or application window, so you can make room for bigger mockups if you need to.\n"

They\u0026rsquo;ll fade out in a few seconds, but you can always bring them back by mousing over the bottom-right corner of the screen.\nThe first toggle is for showing and hiding linking hints and the big pointers. You can turn them off if you\u0026rsquo;re using the presentation mode to test a new UI on some user and don\u0026rsquo;t want to give them hints on where to click, or simply if you find the big pointer distracting.\nThe second toggle is for showing and hiding markup elements, such as Sticky Notes, Arrows and Callouts (any control under the \u0026ldquo;Markup\u0026rdquo; tab in the UI Library). This is useful if you want to just look at your UI without the annotations that surround it.\nThe third button lets you exit full-screen mode and edit the mockup you\u0026rsquo;re currently viewing.\nTo exit Full Screen Presentation mode, just hit the ESC key.\n"

This document outlines a few different ways so that you can pick the right one to fit each situation.\nTo learn how to work on the same wireframes together, see our article on Collaborative Editing.\nReviewing and Commenting The \u0026ldquo;Review and Comment\u0026rdquo; mode is a great option for anyone who does not need to edit the wireframes. You can easily switch to this mode from the top-right option in the toolbar.\nNotice how the border color around the profile picture switches from green to orange.\nThe comments panel allows you to collaborate on your designs by sharing feedback asynchronously or, if you prefer, making notes for yourself as you work. A new comment will generate a notification in the toolbar.\nCallouts You can add Callout markers to indicate specific places in the wireframe where the comments applies. See the image below to learn how.\nLinking to an Alternate Version You can also add a link to an alternate version by using the \u0026ldquo;Add Link to Alternate\u0026rdquo; drop-down at the bottom of the comments panel.\nComment Actions Once a comment is added, each reviewer can reply to it and like it. You can also edit and delete your own comments.\nFull Screen Presentation Mode The Full Screen Presentation Mode is great for sharing your wireframes with stakeholders or for usability testing. If you have created links between your wireframes, the links will be clickable.\nTo enter it, just click on the full-screen icon in the top-right corner of your toolbar, select \u0026ldquo;Full Screen Presentation\u0026rdquo; from the View menu or simply hit CTRL/CMD+F.\nThe application will expand to take up your whole screen, with your wireframe centered on it. You can learn more about this feature in Full Screen Presentation Mode.\nSharing an Interactive PDF Document PDFs generated in Balsamiq Wireframes are completely interactive. That means that they not only display your project as you have designed it, they will also respect any links you have added to the project. This is one of the best ways to share your project with collaborators and clients who don\u0026rsquo;t need to make changes.\nThe PDF will be created in high resolution and with selectable text (good for the reviewers to copy/paste from). More details about exporting to PDF can be found here.\nSharing PNG Images You can export all of your wireframes to static PNG images, to easily send to clients. You can learn more about exporting to images here.\n"

    "content": " Balsamiq Wireframes supports the concept of Symbols. A Symbol is a group of controls that represents a single piece of functionality. It is often used for parts of the user interface that show up on several screens. Other software sometimes refers to this feature as templates, master pages, custom components, or widgets.\nIn essence, Symbols let you create reusable common elements that you can use across different wireframes.\nCreating Symbols There are two ways to create a Symbol, described below.\n1. Using the Symbols View The editor has a dedicated view for creating and managing Symbols. Symbols created using the Wireframes view will be shown here, and you can also create Symbols in this view.\nTo get to the Symbols view, click on the View menu and select Symbols. You will see any existing Symbols in a list in the left panel.\nClick the New Symbol Library icon to create a new Symbol Library. The Symbols view shows Symbols as well as their Symbol Library containers. In Symbols view it is helpful to know the difference before creating them. Read on for an explanation.\nSymbols vs. Symbol Libraries A Symbol Library is a collection of individual Symbols. It can be used as a way of grouping Symbols with similar purposes. Symbol Libraries are useful for managing and organizing Symbols if you have a lot of them. If you aren\u0026rsquo;t a heavy user of Symbols you can keep them all in one Symbol Library (you can always add more Symbol Libraries later).\nIn Symbols view Symbols are shown as a nested list inside their Symbol Library, as shown below.\nYou can select the Symbol Library name to see all the Symbols it contains, or you can select the name of an individual Symbol to see only that Symbol.\nWhen viewing a Symbol you will see a small floating bar showing a breadcrumb path to the Symbol Library. If you have groups within your Symbol the breadcrumb bar will help you navigate back out of the groups.\nThe icon at the top of the list of Symbols allows you to choose whether you want to see other Symbols in the Symbol Library along with the selected Symbol or not.\nNote: The Symbol Library that a Symbol belongs to is ignored in the UI Library and Quick Add. You will see a list of all your Symbols, regardless of which Symbol Library they belong to. Creating Symbols in the Symbols View Creating Symbols in Symbols view is similar to creating Symbols in Wireframes view, except that you don\u0026rsquo;t need to group them. Any controls you add to the Symbol become part of it immediately.\nAs described above you can add a new Symbol to an existing Symbol Library or inside a new one. To create a new Symbol, click the \u0026lsquo;+\u0026rsquo; icon to the right of a Symbol Library. This will create a new Symbol inside that Symbol Library (called \u0026ldquo;New Symbol\u0026rdquo;, for example).\nWhen you create a new Symbol Library two sample Symbols are created automatically to help you learn about how Symbols work. Feel free to modify or delete them.\nNote: You can add controls to the Symbol Library itself, but these controls will not be shown when the Symbols are used in your wireframes. Adding controls such as sticky notes to your Symbol Libraries can be useful for making notes about them that don\u0026rsquo;t need to be shown in the UI. 2. Creating Symbols in the Wireframes View Creating a Symbol in the Wireframes view starts with grouping the set of controls that you want to become your Symbol. You can create a new group or use a group you already have. The following steps assume you are creating a new group.\n Select the controls you want to group.\n Group your selection (select Edit \u0026gt;Group, click the Group icon in the toolbar, or use CTRL/CMD+G). Note that the controls will turn a bluish color to indicate they are a group.\n Name the group.\n Click on the \u0026ldquo;Convert To Symbol\u0026rdquo; button in the Property Inspector\n  You will notice that the group selection becomes a light green. This means that the selection is now an instance of a Symbol and you can reuse it in your project.\nThis new Symbol will be displayed in the Symbols category of the UI Library for all wireframes in your project so that you can easily add it to any wireframe.\nTip: Once a Symbol has been created you can also add it via Quick Add using the first few letters of its name, just like other controls. The video below describes the process of creating, editing, and using Symbols.\n Importing Symbols from Wireframes to Go You can find the option to launch the Wireframes to Go browser window from either the Project \u0026gt; Import Controls from Wireframes to Go menu item, or the More Controls button to the right of the UI Library\u0026rsquo;s categories.\nOnce you have launched the Wireframes to Go window, you can either browse for symbols to add to your project, or search for them.\nWhen you have found the symbols you want to add, simply click on them. This will open them up, allowing you to take a closer look. To add them to your project, click the Import into Project button.\nThe Wireframes to Go Browser will close, and you will see a little toast message in the bottom right corner saying that the symbol has been imported. You can double check by going to the Symbols View, and looking for the symbols in the navigator. From there, you can view, edit, or delete them.\nUsing Symbols in Your Wireframes You can use Symbols just like any other control. You can add them from the UI Library or Quick Add and move and arrange them with other controls in your wireframes.\nThe primary difference is that the properties for the Symbol itself are limited, similar to other grouped controls.\nThe big advantage is, of course, that any changes you make to your Symbols will update everywhere you use them. Read on to learn about editing Symbols.\nEditing Symbols When you select a Symbol on the canvas you\u0026rsquo;ll see two Symbol properties in the Property Inspector: Break Apart and Edit Source.\n\u0026ldquo;Break Apart\u0026rdquo; breaks the connection between the individual controls inside the Symbol and the Symbol itself for the selected instance, meaning that it is no longer a Symbol (although the original Symbol remains intact). Any changes you make to a broken apart Symbol will not get updated elsewhere and any changes made to the Symbol will not update where it has been broken apart.\n\u0026ldquo;Edit Source\u0026rdquo; does what you\u0026rsquo;d expect it to do, it takes you to the Symbols view where you can edit the Symbol. The main benefit of reusable Symbols is that if you need to make a change, you can just do it in one place and it will be propagated to all the instances (uses) of that Symbol. When you are done editing a Symbol you can click the \u0026ldquo;Back to Wireframes\u0026rdquo; button on the canvas. Edits made to the Symbol will be immediately reflected in any wireframes that it is used in.\nTip: You can also edit a Symbol by right-clicking on it in the UI Library and selecting \u0026ldquo;Edit Symbol Source.\u0026rdquo; Overriding Symbol Properties Once you have created a Symbol, you might want to change it a little each time you use it. Imagine for instance a Symbol you created as a master page or template, containing a web page\u0026rsquo;s title and navigation.\nAll your website pages will have the same font size and position for the title, but the title\u0026rsquo;s text should be different on each page. The same goes for which page should be shown as selected in your navigation bar.\nSymbols allow you to achieve this result by letting you override certain Symbol properties each time you use a Symbol. To do so, start by double-clicking on a symbol to \u0026ldquo;enter it\u0026rdquo;. Although this experience is very similar to editing a group\u0026rsquo;s contents, you will notice that the editor informs you that what you\u0026rsquo;re doing is really overriding some properties of a Symbol.\nAt this point, you can manipulate each control inside the symbols at will, as if you were editing a group. Some operations are not permitted while overriding symbol properties, such as adding, deleting or grouping controls. If, instead, you want to edit all instances of the Symbol click the \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026rdquo; button.\nIf you make a mistake, you can always undo to get back. If you want to remove a single property change and go back to a Symbol\u0026rsquo;s default property, you can click on the little green \u0026ldquo;x\u0026rdquo; icon in the Property Inspector.\nYou can also revert all changes you made to a Symbol\u0026rsquo;s instance at once, via the \u0026ldquo;x\u0026rdquo; icon in the Property Inspector you see when selecting the whole symbol.\nUsing Symbols across Projects If you want to use the same Symbol in multiple projects, you can copy it to another project. You can also create a template project, described in Using Symbols and Assets across Projects.\nManaging Symbols In addition to creating Symbols and Symbol Libraries in Symbols view, it is also a good place to manage and organize your Symbols.\nYou can add notes to both your Symbols and Symbol Libraries in the Properties panel on the right. When an individual Symbol is selected the lower portion of the panel shows which wireframes (if any) the Symbol is used in. This can be used to see if you can delete any Symbols that aren\u0026rsquo;t being used, for example. Clicking on a wireframe name will take you to that wireframe in the Wireframes view. Renaming Symbols To rename either a Symbol or Symbol Library you can double-click its name in the navigator panel on the left or use the context menu.\nDeleting Symbols You can also use the context menu to delete Symbols and Symbol Libraries from your project. In the case of Symbol Libraries, like with wireframes and images, deleting will move them to the trash, where you can delete them permanently or restore them. Deleting an individual Symbol from a Symbol Library, however, deletes it permanently.\nTip: You can hold down Shift or Control/CMD to select multiple Symbols and delete or move multiple Symbols at once. Just like with images, deleting a Symbol from a wireframe does not delete the Symbol, only that instance of the Symbol.\nCloning Symbols Cloning Symbols (also available via the context menu) can save you time when creating Symbols or Symbol Libraries that are similar.\nMoving Symbols You can move individual Symbols from one Symbol Library to another by dragging them around in the Symbols view. You can also copy Symbols from one project to another as described above.\n"

    "content": " There are multiple ways to add images and icons to your wireframes. The easiest way is to simply drag and drop an image file from your computer on to the wireframes canvas. Read on to learn more about adding and using images, icons, and other assets to your projects.\nAdding Images in Wireframes View As mentioned above, dragging an image from your computer to the editor will add it to the canvas. Doing this will place the image into the selected wireframe and copy the image file to your Assets so that you can easily reuse it in other wireframes.\nYou can modify the image properties in the Property Inspector, similar to other UI controls.\nThe properties specific to images are as follows:\n The drop-down box shows you the name of the current image. Opening it allows you to select a different image from the images you\u0026rsquo;ve already imported to your Assets. The \u0026rdquo;+\u0026rdquo; icon next to the drop-down box allows you to add an image from your computer. This is the same as dragging and dropping an image file. Clicking the cloud opens a dialog to add image from the web by entering a URL directly or by searching Flickr. wireframes supports GIF, JPG/JPEG, and PNG image file formats. Files downloaded from the web will be copied to your project. Click the rotate icon below the image drop-down to rotate your image in 90-degree increments. Clicking the square with an \u0026lsquo;x\u0026rsquo; inside it will revert the image to the default placeholder image. The \u0026ldquo;Sketch it!\u0026rdquo; checkbox will convert your image to a black and white line drawing version.  If you don\u0026rsquo;t yet have an image ready or want to use a placeholder image to keep your wireframe low-fidelity, you can add an Image control from the UI Library and it will show up as a box with an \u0026lsquo;X\u0026rsquo; through it. You can later replace it with an image using the image properties described above.\nOnce an image has been added to your project it will show up in the UI Library so that you can easily add it to any wireframe in your project. The \u0026ldquo;Assets\u0026rdquo; category will show all of the images that you\u0026rsquo;ve added to your project.\nThis also means that you can add your images to your wireframes from the Quick Add box. Just type the first few letters of the image name and it will appear in the list.\nNote: You can delete an image by right-clicking on it in the UI Library and selecting \u0026ldquo;Move Image to Trash\u0026rdquo; or from the context menu in the Assets view. The image properties panel also allows you to crop or mask images to only show a selected portion of them. You can watch a tutorial on cropping images here. Images that have been cropped will show an icon to remove the cropping in the properties panel.\nAside from the Image control, you can also embed images in the Cover Flow control.\nAdding Images in Assets View Balsamiq Wireframes has a dedicated area of the user interface for managing images, icons and other assets called the Assets view.\nThe Assets view shows all images and custom icons that have been added to your project. You can get to it by via the View menu.\nYou can add images in the Assets view by dragging and dropping from your computer or by using the icons in the toolbar.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Import Asset\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; icon allows you to select one or more images from your computer while the \u0026ldquo;Download Asset\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; icon brings up the same dialog as in the wireframes view to enter an image URL or search for an image from Flickr.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve added images, you can view them as thumbnails or a list, as well as in Thumbnail Grid view.\nThe Properties panel on the right shows you the pixel dimensions of the selected image and allows you to enter notes about it. The lower portion of the panel shows which wireframes (if any) the image is used in. This can be used for managing images to see if you can delete any that aren\u0026rsquo;t being used, for example. Clicking on a wireframe name will take you to that wireframe in the wireframes view.\nAdding Non-Image Assets You can also store other types of files in your project that won\u0026rsquo;t be used in your wireframes, such as requirements documents, Photoshop or Illustrator files, PDFs, or any other file that\u0026rsquo;s associated with the project. We call these \u0026ldquo;non-image assets\u0026rdquo; and they can be added to your project by dragging them into the Assets view, just like images. Common file types (zip, pdf, doc, etc.) will be shown with an appropriate logo, as shown below. Other files will be have a generic document icon.\nNote: Assets are limited to 20 Megabytes per file for performance reasons. These files can\u0026rsquo;t be viewed inside the application, but they are \u0026ldquo;packaged\u0026rdquo; with your project, so if you give the project file to someone else they will be able to save the files from the Balsamiq project to their computer using the \u0026ldquo;Save to disk\u0026rdquo; button or context menu item.\nManaging Images and Other Assets As with the wireframes view, the Assets view has a context menu that you can open by right-clicking in the navigator or using the drop-down arrow. This allows you to rename, delete, update, or download your images and other assets.\nRenaming Assets Renaming assets using the context menu will change the name of the asset in your project. It will not affect the original file, as the asset is a copy that has been added to your project. Renamed images will get updated in your wireframes, so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to update them manually.\nSaving Assets from Your Project to Your Computer You can get assets from your project on to your computer by using the \u0026ldquo;Save to Disk\u0026rdquo; option in the context menu, allowing you to extract assets from your project for other uses.\nReplacing or Updating Assets The \u0026ldquo;Import New Version\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; menu option allows you to select a new assets to replace the selected assets with. This is useful if you want to update an image that is already in use in your wireframes, for example. The new version will then be used anywhere the selected image was used.\nDeleting Assets You can also use the context menu to delete assets from your project. Just like your wireframes, deleting will move assets to the trash, where you can delete them permanently or restore them. Note that deleting an image from the wireframes canvas doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove it from your project.\nSelect Unused Images Another option allows you to select all images that are not used in your wireframes. The option is available in the Edit menu, as shown below:\nSelecting it will open the Assets view where all the unused images will be selected for you. You can then delete them as explained above. This is a great way to reduce your project\u0026rsquo;s file size.\nAdding Icons via the UI Library and Quick Add Icons from the amazing Font Awesome icon set are pre-installed. It contains over 500 icons in a wide range of categories that can be sized from very small to very large. It is also updated frequently and we plan to keep up with the updates whenever we release a new version of our product\nIcons have their own category in the UI Library so you can drag and drop them just like any other control.\nNot only that, they show up in the Quick Add results, saving you time when searching by name or keyword.\nIcon search results are shown below any UI controls that match the text you enter.\nAdding and Swapping Icons via the Property Inspector Some controls allow you to add icons to them (buttons, for example). You can do this from the Property Inspector in one of two ways: the icon search and the icon library dialog.\nIcon Search If the control you selected support icons, you will see the icon search box in the property inspector. This works much like the Quick Add tool, just type a few letters from the name of the icon you are looking for and a list of suggestions will pop up as a grid of icons to choose from. Just click on the one you want to select it.\nYou can then size the icon from \u0026ldquo;XS\u0026rdquo; (16px) to \u0026ldquo;XXL\u0026rdquo; (128px). You can also rotate icons in 90 degree increments using the button next to the search box.\nThe Icon Library Dialog If you\u0026rsquo;d like to explore all the icons that are available, click on the icon to the right of the icon search box.\nThis will bring up the icon library dialog, where you can browse the icons by category and preview them at different sizes. You can double-click an icon to select it immediately or click once to select and then click the \u0026ldquo;Select\u0026rdquo; button to add it.\nOnce you have selected an icon, you can resize it, rotate it or remove it via the Property Inspector.\nAdding Your Own Icons You can also easily add your own icons for use in your wireframes by selecting any of your imported images, and using them as an icon. They will automatically show up in the icon library, under the Assets category at the bottom.\nBest Practices for Creating or Preparing Custom Icons The editor recognizes color and transparency, but icons you add may not turn out looking as you want them to if they\u0026rsquo;re not prepared the way we expect. Below are some tips to get the most out of your custom icons.\nColor  Wireframes uses black as a color for replacement at 100% opacity. Icons that aren\u0026rsquo;t created with black can have undesirable effects when colorized. We recommend using black as the color for your icons.  Transparent Areas  Wireframes colorizes the entire opaque area of the icon. For best results, we recommend knocking out \u0026ldquo;white\u0026rdquo; areas of your icon using transparency. Transparent PNG works best.  The example below shows regular icons in the left column, a custom icon properly prepared with black fills in the middle column, and a custom icon that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work as well in the right column. To fix the icon in the right column, the exclamation point should be made transparent, and the icon color should be black.\n"

    "tags": [],
    "description": "",
    "content": " Alternates (also sometimes referred to as versions or branches) allow you to create variations on a single mockup design without adding more mockups to your project.\nCreating alternates can be useful during the early design phase when exploring concepts and in later stages for reviewers to add their feedback and propose changes.\nSome possible reasons for using alternates:\n You want to create only one mockup per screen but have several ideas about each one. You want suggestions for design improvements but don\u0026rsquo;t want other people changing your mockups. You want to send your project around for feedback and track each person\u0026rsquo;s feedback individually. You want to try out new design ideas without including them in the mockups for the current release.  Here\u0026rsquo;s an overview:\n Creating Alternates When viewing a mockup without any controls selected you will see a section of the Property Inspector panel called \u0026ldquo;Alternate Versions\u0026rdquo; below the notes for that mockup.\nTo create a new alternate click the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; (plus) icon next to \u0026ldquo;Alternate Versions\u0026rdquo;\nor use the context menu in the Navigator panel.\nThis will create a copy of the current mockup as an alternate version for you to modify. By default it will automatically be named with the word \u0026ldquo;Alternate\u0026rdquo; followed by some random numbers and letters to ensure that the name is unique.\nThe selection in the alternate versions list tells you which version of the mockup you are working on. You can create as many alternates as you\u0026rsquo;d like.\nNote: You can create an alternate of an alternate. Clicking the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; (plus) icon when an alternate is selected creates an alternate of the selected version rather than the official version. When an alternate exists an icon will appear next to the name in the Navigator panel indicating that there are alternates. When you are working on an alternate version the Navigator panel will show the alternate name in parentheses.\nTo rename the alternate double-click on the name in the alternates versions list or use the context or right-click menu and select \u0026ldquo;Rename\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nEditing Alternates Once you have created an alternate version you can edit it just like any other mockup, including adding assets and symbols. Changes that you make will not affect the original mockup (shown as the Official Version). You can also add notes in the notes panel for the alternate to describe your thoughts on it or communicate to others about it.\nTo switch between alternate versions of a mockup select the name of a version from the list in the properties panel or from the context menu in the Navigator panel. You may also switch back to the Official Version by selecting it in the list.\nNote: If you link to a mockup that contains an alternate the link will go to the version of the mockup that is selected in the alternates list. The same rule applies to exporting. The selected versions of your mockups will be exported. Promoting Alternates If you decide that you like one alternate better than the original mockup you can \u0026ldquo;promote\u0026rdquo; it to the official version, which replaces and overwrites the original.\nNote: You can undo this action by using the undo command (CTRL/CMD+Z) three times. The alternate that was promoted is retained in case you want to preserve it as part of the change history. Otherwise you can discard it.\nDuplicating Alternates You can duplicate mockups from the contextual menu. Doing this will create a new, randomly named alternate that is an exact copy of the alternate you chose to duplicate.\nSometimes, however, an alternate grows into a mockup all its own. If you would like to create a whole new mockup based on an alternate, you can choose the \u0026ldquo;Duplicate As New Mockup\u0026rdquo; option from the contextual menu.\nThe new mockup will be named using the Name of the Alternate and then the Name of the Original Mockup. So if you had an alternate named \u0026ldquo;Rotated Header\u0026rdquo;, in your \u0026ldquo;Homepage\u0026rdquo; mockup, the mockup created from the alternate would be named \u0026ldquo;Rotated Header Homepage\u0026rdquo;.\nMerging Alternates If you want to combine parts of an alternate with the official version, you can use the merge option.\nSelecting \u0026ldquo;Merge with Official\u0026rdquo; will add the contents of the selected version to the official version, to the right of the mockup contents, as shown below.\nIf the notes in the alternate are different than the notes in the original, they will also be merged, separated by a dashed horizontal line.\nYou can then manually edit the contents to create a new official version that is a combination of the preferred elements of each version.\nDiscarding Alternates When you have finished reviewing or integrating alternate versions into an official version you can delete alternates you no longer want using the \u0026ldquo;Discard\u0026rdquo; option.\nNote: Alternates cannot be recovered after they have been discarded. Alternates in Full Screen Presentation Mode You can view your alternates in Full Screen Presentation Mode by using the navigator dropdown.\nWhen you select a mockup alternate in this view, its name will show up in parentheses next to the official mockup name.\nProject Alternates In some cases you might want to propose a set of alternate designs across several mockups. This might happen if you are reviewing someone else\u0026rsquo;s mockups and want them to see your proposed design changes throughout the project.\nWhen you rename an alternate you can choose from a list of existing alternate names in the rename dialog. This makes it easy to use the same alternate name in several mockups.\nIn the Navigator panel next to the word Mockups a menu shows the names of all alternates that appear in your project.\nSelecting an alternate from this list will select that alternate in all the mockups that have an alternate with that name.\nNote: This is conceptually similar to creating a branch in a codebase, except that it only applies to mockups that have specific alternate version names. So, for example, if you create a series of alternates called \u0026ldquo;Leon\u0026rsquo;s Proposal\u0026rdquo; and use the context menu shown above to select that name, any mockup with an alternate called \u0026ldquo;Leon\u0026rsquo;s Proposal\u0026rdquo; would switch views to that alternate version.\nMockups without an alternate with that name would not be updated. Promoting, merging, and discarding actions are not available across multiple mockups at once.\n"

    "content": " Balsamiq Mockups and myBalsamiq come packed with over 600 icons courtesy of the Font Awesome Icon Library.\nThere are two ways to select an icon to use: the icon search and the icon library.\nIcon Search If the controls you selected support icons, you will see the icon search box in the property inspector. This works much like the Quick Add tool: just type a few letters from the name of the icon you are looking for and a list of suggestions will pop up. In this case, the list is a grid of icons to choose from. Just click on the one you want to select it.\nThe Icon Library If you\u0026rsquo;d like to explore all the icons that are available, click on the little down-pointing arrow to the right of the icon-search box. This will bring up the icon library, where you can browse the icons by category and preview them at different sizes. One trick is to double-click on the icon you\u0026rsquo;d like to select, instead of clicking to select and then clicking on the \u0026ldquo;Select\u0026rdquo; button.\nOnce you have selected an icon, you can resize it, rotate it or remove it via the Property Inspector.\nAdding Your Own Custom Icons Note: Custom icons are not currently supported in our Mockups for Confluence and Jira server plugins. This feature is coming in version 3! If you\u0026rsquo;d like to get your own custom icons into your projects, these are the steps to follow:\nFirst, you will need to rename the icon file so that it has \u0026ldquo;icon_\u0026rdquo; at the front of the file name.\nOnce your icon file is ready, you will want to open the asset manager on either your home page, or the project page.\nIn the asset manager, choose whether the icon needs to be a site asset or a project asset, and then upload it.\nNow the icon can be added to your mockups. Add an icon control to your mockup, open the icon library from the property inspector and select the asset section (project or site) that you uploaded it to.\nBest Practices for Creating or Preparing Your Custom Icons Mockups works with color and transparency, but icons you add may not turn out looking as you want them to if they\u0026rsquo;re not prepared to work the way Mockups expects them to. Below are some tips to get the most out of your custom icons.\nColor\n Mockups uses black as a color for replacement at 100% opacity. Icons that aren\u0026rsquo;t created with black can have undesirable effects when colorized. We recommend using black as the color for your icons.  Transparent Areas\n Mockups colorizes the entire opaque area of the icon. For best results, we recommend knocking out \u0026ldquo;white\u0026rdquo; areas of your icon using transparency. Transparent PNG works best.  The example below shows regular icons in the left column, a custom icon properly prepared with black fills in the middle column, and a custom icon that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work as well in the right column. To fix the icon in the right column, the exclamation point should be made transparent, and the icon color should be black.\n"

    "content": " Balsamiq Mockups 3 includes the amazing Font Awesome icon set. It contains over 500 icons in a wide range of categories that can be sized from very small to very large. It is also updated frequently and we plan to keep up with the updates whenever we release a new version of our product (more about why we switched here).\nIt should meet all your icon needs, but if not, you can add your own icons or request new ones from Font Awesome.\nIcons from previous versions of Balsamiq Mockups have been remapped to the new icons.\nAdding Icons via the UI Library and Quick Add Also new in Balsamiq 3, icons now have their own category in the UI Library so you can drag and drop them just like any other control.\nNot only that, they show up in the Quick Add results, saving you time when searching by name or keyword.\nIcon search results are shown below any UI controls that match the text you enter.\nAdding and Swapping Icons via the Property Inspector Some controls allow you to add icons to them (buttons, for example). You can do this from the Property Inspector in one of two ways: the icon search and the icon library dialog.\nIcon Search If the control you selected support icons, you will see the icon search box in the property inspector. This works much like the Quick Add tool, just type a few letters from the name of the icon you are looking for and a list of suggestions will pop up as a grid of icons to choose from. Just click on the one you want to select it.\nYou can then size the icon from \u0026ldquo;XS\u0026rdquo; (16px) to \u0026ldquo;XXL\u0026rdquo; (128px). You can also rotate icons in 90 degree increments using the button next to the search box.\nThe Icon Library Dialog If you\u0026rsquo;d like to explore all the icons that are available, click on the icon to the right of the icon search box.\nThis will bring up the icon library dialog, where you can browse the icons by category and preview them at different sizes. You can double-click an icon to select it immediately or click once to select and then click the \u0026ldquo;Select\u0026rdquo; button to add it.\nOnce you have selected an icon, you can resize it, rotate it or remove it via the Property Inspector.\nAdding Your Own Icons You can also easily add your own icons for use in your wireframes.\nUsing Your Image Assets You can pick any of your imported image assets and use it as an icon. They will automatically show up in the icon library, under the Assets category at the bottom.\nAdding via the Icon Library Dialog You can also add your own icons from the icon library dialog.\nSelect the Assets category, then click the little plus button, select an image file and your image will be resized down to fit an existing icon size and copied to your assets.\nBest Practices for Creating or Preparing Custom Icons Mockups works with color and transparency, but icons you add may not turn out looking as you want them to if they\u0026rsquo;re not prepared to work the way Mockups expects them to. Below are some tips to get the most out of your custom icons.\nColor  Mockups uses black as a color for replacement at 100% opacity.

    "content": " Adding Images To use images in Mockups, add an Image control from the UI Library and place it on the canvas. The Image drop-down in the Property Inspector will allow you to select images that have already been imported/used in your mockup or import a new one.\nThe Project Assets panel shows all images in your assets. If you have Site/Account assets, a tab will appear for them. If you use web images or images using relative paths that are not project assets, those will show in the Other Assets tab. On the desktop, you\u0026rsquo;ll also see a handy link to open the Account Assets folder when you click on the Account Assets tab.\nClick the plus icon in the upper right corner of the drop-down to choose a new image, or just double-click on the Image UI control to quickly bring up the image browser dialog. You can choose images from your hard drive or networked drive, or from the Web or Flickr. Mockups supports GIF, JPG/JPEG, and PNG image file formats.\nIf you are working on a saved file, you can also just drag an image from your computer to the Mockups canvas.\nNote: The dragging feature is only available on the Desktop version of Mockups. To rotate an image after it\u0026rsquo;s been imported, click the rotate icon next to the Image drop-down in the Property Inspector. To convert an image to a black and white line drawing version, click the \u0026ldquo;Sketch It\u0026rdquo; checkbox in the image import dialog or the Property Inspector.\nTo revert an image to the default placeholder image, click the icon in the upper left corner of the image drop-down (the square with an \u0026lsquo;x\u0026rsquo; inside it).\nThe image properties panel also allows you to crop or mask images to only show a selected portion of them. You can watch a tutorial on cropping images here. Images that have been cropped will show an icon to remove the cropping in the properties panel.\nAside from the Image control, you can also embed images in the Cover Flow control.\nCopying Images to Assets When you add images to Mockups, what we suggest is that you also add them to \u0026ldquo;project assets\u0026rdquo; so they will stay organized with the project and may be re-used in other mockups.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how:\n If your Mockup isn\u0026rsquo;t saved, Save your Mockup. Add an image to your Mockup. In the lower left corner of the Property Inspector, check \u0026ldquo;Copy to Project Assets\u0026rdquo; so this image will stay organized with the project and can be re-used in other mockups.  After you add an image, it will be available in the Property Inspector.\nNote: This will be automatically done in our web based versions since the image will be added to Project Assets. Using Images as Custom Icons Mockups also allows you to import your own icons. Importing an image with \u0026ldquo;icon_\u0026rdquo; at the front of the file name will make it appear in the Icon Library, under the Project Assets category.\nMore details about Custom Icons can be found here.\n"

    "content": " There are multiple ways to add images to your mockups. The easiest way is to simply drag and drop an image file from your computer on to the Mockups canvas. Read on to learn more about adding and using images and other assets in your projects.\nAdding Images in Mockups View As mentioned above, dragging an image from your computer to Balsamiq Mockups will add it to the canvas. Doing this will place the image into the selected mockup and copy the image file to your Assets so that you can easily reuse it in other mockups.\nYou can modify the image properties in the Property Inspector, similar to other UI controls.\nThe properties specific to images are as follows:\n The drop-down box shows you the name of the current image. Opening it allows you to select a different image from the images you\u0026rsquo;ve already imported to your Assets. The \u0026rdquo;+\u0026rdquo; icon next to the drop-down box allows you to add an image from your computer. This is the same as dragging and dropping an image file. Clicking the download icon opens a dialog to add image from the web by entering a URL directly or by searching Flickr. Mockups supports GIF, JPG/JPEG, and PNG image file formats. Files downloaded from the web will be copied to your project. Click the rotate icon below the image drop-down to rotate your image in 90-degree increments. Clicking the square with an \u0026lsquo;x\u0026rsquo; inside it will revert the image to the default placeholder image. The \u0026ldquo;Sketch it!\u0026rdquo; checkbox will convert your image to a black and white line drawing version.  If you don\u0026rsquo;t yet have an image ready or want to use a placeholder image to keep your mockup low-fidelity, you can add an Image control from the UI Library and it will show up as a box with an \u0026lsquo;X\u0026rsquo; through it. You can later replace it with an image using the image properties described above.\nOnce an image has been added to your project it will show up in the UI Library so that you can easily add it to any mockup in your project. The \u0026ldquo;Assets\u0026rdquo; category will show all of the images that you\u0026rsquo;ve added to your project.\nThis also means that you can add your images to your mockups from the Quick Add box. Just type the first few letters of the image name and it will appear in the list.\nNote: You can delete an image by right-clicking on it in the UI Library and selecting \u0026ldquo;Move Image to Trash\u0026rdquo; or from the context menu in the Assets view. The image properties panel also allows you to crop or mask images to only show a selected portion of them. You can watch a tutorial on cropping images here. Images that have been cropped will show an icon to remove the cropping in the properties panel.\nAside from the Image control, you can also embed images in the Cover Flow control.\nAdding Images in Assets View Balsamiq Mockups 3 has a dedicated area of the user interface for managing images, icons and other assets called the Assets view.\nThe Assets view shows all images and custom icons that have been added to your project. You can get to it by switching the navigator view to Assets.\nYou can add images in the Assets view by dragging and dropping from your computer or by using the icons in the toolbar.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Import Asset\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; icon allows you to select one or more images from your computer while the \u0026ldquo;Download Asset\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; icon brings up the same dialog as in the Mockups view to enter an image URL or search for an image from Flickr.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve added images, you can view them as thumbnails or a list, as well as in Thumbnail Grid view.\nThe Properties panel on the right shows you the pixel dimensions of the selected image and allows you to enter notes about it. The lower portion of the panel shows which mockups (if any) the image is used in. This can be used for managing images to see if you can delete any that aren\u0026rsquo;t being used, for example. Clicking on a mockup name will take you to that mockup in the Mockups view.\nAdding Non-Image Assets You can also store other types of files in your project that won\u0026rsquo;t be used in your mockups, such as requirements documents, Photoshop or Illustrator files, PDFs, or any other file that\u0026rsquo;s associated with the project. We call these \u0026ldquo;non-image assets\u0026rdquo; and they can be added to your project by dragging them into the Assets view, just like images. Common file types (zip, pdf, doc, etc.) will be shown with an appropriate logo, as shown below. Other files will be have a generic document icon.\nNote: Assets are limited to 20 Megabytes per file for performance reasons. These files can\u0026rsquo;t be viewed inside the application, but they are \u0026ldquo;packaged\u0026rdquo; with your project, so if you give the project file to someone else they will be able to save the files from the Balsamiq project to their computer using the \u0026ldquo;Save to disk\u0026rdquo; button or context menu item.\nManaging Images and Other Assets As with the Mockups view, the Assets view has a context menu that you can open by right-clicking in the navigator or using the drop-down arrow. This allows you to rename, delete, update, or download your images and other assets.\nRenaming Assets Renaming assets using the context menu will change the name of the asset in your project. It will not affect the original file, as the asset is a copy that has been added to your project. Renamed images will get updated in your mockups, so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to update them manually.\nSaving Assets from Your Project to Your Computer You can get assets from your project on to your computer by using the \u0026ldquo;Save to Disk\u0026rdquo; option in the context menu, allowing you to extract assets from your project for other uses.\nReplacing or Updating Assets The \u0026ldquo;Import New Version\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; menu option allows you to select a new assets to replace the selected assets with. This is useful if you want to update an image that is already in use in your mockups, for example. The new version will then be used anywhere the selected image was used.\nDeleting Assets You can also use the context menu to delete assets from your project. Just like your mockups, deleting will move assets to the trash, where you can delete them permanently or restore them. Note that deleting an image from the mockups canvas doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove it from your project.\nSelect Unused Images Another option allows you to select all images that are not used in your mockups. The option is available in the Edit menu, as shown below:\nSelecting it will open the Assets view where all the unused images will be selected for you. You can then delete them as explained above. This is a great way to reduce your project\u0026rsquo;s file size.\nUsing Images as Icons You can use any of your imported image assets as an icon. They will automatically show up in the icon library, under the Assets category at the bottom.\n"

Here\u0026rsquo;s an example:\nHome - Products -- Product 1 -- Product 2 - About Us\\rCompany - Support - Blog  Using the Property Inspector you can add links to the nodes in the map and change the text properties and orientation of the map (vertical or horizontal).\nThis is what the outline above looks like in vertical orientation (default):\n\u0026hellip;and in horizontal orientation:\nGenerating Site Maps Automatically Next to the options for changing the orientation in the Property Inspector is a button that allows you to automatically populate a site map based on the order and structure of your mockups in the Navigator Panel.\nEach time you click the \u0026ldquo;Populate from Project\u0026rdquo; project the site map will be updated to reflect the current project structure.\nIf you are using mockup hierarchy, child mockups will be shown as child nodes in the site map, as shown below.\nLinks will be added to each node in the site map to the corresponding mockup in your project.\nNotes and Options  Single Tree Support: Site Map expects the first line to be the top-most parent, and only one of these can exist because it only makes a single tree. If you want to make multiple trees, just add more Site Map controls. Multi-Line Text: You can use \\r to create line returns on text in a box like this: About\\rUs You can\u0026rsquo;t resize Site Maps, but if you are unable to view the entire map on your canvas you can try changing the orientation or showing one of the nodes expanded in a separate Site Map, as shown below.

We\u0026rsquo;re glad you asked ;-) The short answer is that we still feel that the sketch skin is more appropriate most of the time while using Mockups.\nOur intention with adding the wireframe skin was to help add legitimacy to your Mockups when presenting them to clients or stakeholders, people who may consciously or unconsciously discount the thought and effort of your design work simply because it looks like it was sketched on the back of a napkin. We\u0026rsquo;d hate for all your hard work to go unappreciated just because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look \u0026ldquo;professional\u0026rdquo; enough!\nHowever, while designing, the original sketch skin still offers all the advantages it always has. It deliberately looks rough and tentative, which encourages you, the designer, to try out lots of different ideas, to experiment and revise in order to come up with the best design. Designing in the wireframe skin could cause you to get attached to a specific design idea too soon because it looks \u0026ldquo;done\u0026rdquo;, or it may prompt you to fine-tune the alignment, colors, or fonts when you should be thinking about the workflow.\nJust as the wireframe skin makes the design feel finished, the sketch skin makes the design feel un-finished, which guides you to continue to ask questions and explore. The following description of the differences between sketches and prototypes can also be applied to the sketch and wireframe skins, respectively.\nCredit: Bill Buxton, Sketching User Experiences\nSo, while you can use the wireframe skin at any phase of the design process, we don\u0026rsquo;t really recommend it as an alternative to the sketch skin. But, rather, more as a follow-up to it. It extends the functionality of Mockups by making it more amenable to the presentation or pitching phase of product development, beyond just the ideation and design phase.\nSince the beginning, Balsamiq Mockups has been optimized for that sweet spot of the ideation phase of a project and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. We still don\u0026rsquo;t have any plans to add fancy interaction behavior to our family of products, for example, and we\u0026rsquo;re just fine with that.\n"

If you want to discard the text changes you just made, hit the ESC key.\nSome controls use certain characters as separators. For instance, to create multiple tabs in a tabs bar, you separate them with a comma.\nOr, a space character separates tags in a Tag Cloud control. Some other controls, like the Tree, use other characters altogether. In such cases the default text for the Control includes explanations on how to use it.\nWhen editing text in a Label or Paragraph control you will see a small number in the lower-right corner of the editing box. This is the number of characters, which can be useful for copywriting or other purposes.\nBasic Formatting Text Style You can use the following notation to format only certain parts of your control\u0026rsquo;s text.\n for italic, use _this notation_ for a link, use [this notation] for bold, use *this notation* for disabled, use -this notation- for underlined, use \u0026amp;this notation\u0026amp; for strikethrough, use ~this notation~ for color, use {color:#FF0000}this notation{color}. for font size, use {size:16}this notation{size}  All of the above syntax works around words separated by white spaces, and underline will work within words.\nNotes:\n1. The #FF0000 above is the color in HEX form, just like HTML. The macro will work with or without the pound sign. You can also use certain color names (green, yellow, etc.) which you can find by moving your mouse over the colors in the color palette in the Property Inspector.\n2.

You can do this by writing \\r in front of the text you want to start on a new line. See the example below where a line break is used in the second item in a Radio Button control.\nBulleted Lists In a paragraph control, you can create a bulleted list by preceding text with either a hyphen or an asterisk followed by a space.\n* item 1 * item 2 - item 3 - item 4 Making Links in Text Actually Work If you are using the link notation above (e.g., [this is a link]), you can turn link-formatted text into actual links using markdown syntax.\nTo do this, add the link destination in parentheses immediately after the link text.

Selecting UI Controls There are a few different ways to select UI controls. If you are familiar with graphics software, these should be of no surprise.\n Clicking on a UI control selects it Dragging a rectangle which encloses many UI controls selects them SHIFT+CLICK on a control adds it to the selection SHIFT+CLICK on a selected control removes it from the selection  To select a control that is behind another control, right-click on the top control to bring up a menu that allows you to select controls behind it.\nMoving UI Controls Once you have selected one or more UI controls, there are a few different ways to move it on the canvas.\n You can drag it with your mouse (hold down the SHIFT key to maintain the original horizontal or vertical position) You can \u0026ldquo;nudge it\u0026rdquo; one pixel at a time with your keyboard\u0026rsquo;s UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT keys You can move it with bigger steps by holding down SHIFT and using your keyboard\u0026rsquo;s UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT keys You can move your controls to be aligned in one direction by using the align tools found in the Property Inspector  Snapping and Smart Guides When you move objects on the canvas, Mockups tries to suggest alignment relative to other objects on the canvas using smart guides. This makes alignment a little easier and makes your Mockups generally look neater.\nIf you ever want to temporarily disable this feature, you can hold down the CTRL key while moving or resizing, and snapping will be turned off.\nResizing UI Controls Resizing the selected controls is easy. You can just grab any edge or corner of the selection rectangle and drag it.\nIf you want to constrain proportions while dragging from a corner, hold the SHIFT key while dragging.\nAnother way to resize some controls to their \u0026ldquo;natural size\u0026rdquo; is to use the Auto-Size function found in the Property Inspector.\nAligning UI Controls You can align and distribute (space out) controls by selecting multiple controls and selecting the desired option from the Property Inspector, as shown below.\nLayering UI Controls You can layer controls as if they were pieces of paper on the mockup canvas. To do so, you select the controls you want to layer and select one of four layering commands available via the Property Inspector: bring to front, send to back, bring forward and send backward.\nLocking UI Controls Locking a control will prevent it from being selectable. This can be useful for background controls that you want to stay in place or don\u0026rsquo;t want to accidentally select (a browser or iPhone control, for example). You can lock a control by clicking the lock icon in the Property Inspector.\nTo unlock a control, right-click on it when your mouse cursor is over it.\nDeleting UI Controls To remove some UI controls from the mockup canvas, select them and hit the DELETE key. Alternatively you can click on the trashcan button in the Property Inspector or select \u0026ldquo;delete\u0026rdquo; from the Edit menu.\nRotating UI Controls Some of our UI controls can be rotated via the Property Inspector (the label, image, and icon controls, for example), but most can\u0026rsquo;t. If you are used to generic drawing tools this might be surprising. This limitation is intentional, and not due to programming complexity (it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to add technically).\nThe reason we don\u0026rsquo;t support rotating all controls because we believe that in 90% of cases, it is not needed in wireframes. In fact, adding the ability to rotate any control will likely result in wireframes that are very hard if not impossible to implement by the development team.\nIf you feel that you need to rotate any other control, let us know on this forum thread and we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss whether to add it together. A workaround would be to rotate a control in a drawing application and then import it as an image.\nGrouping UI Controls Sometimes you might wish to group some controls to better align them or to move them all at once. To group a set of controls, select them and hit CTRL+G on your keyboard or use the Group command in the menu or Property Inspector. The controls will change color to purple to indicate that they are grouped. Once grouped, the controls will behave as one when moving or aligning. To ungroup controls, press CTRL+SHIFT+G on your keyboard or use the Ungroup command in the menu or Property Inspector.\nYou can double-click on a group to “enter it” and edit its contents. A small breadcrumb bar (at the bottom of the editor) will indicate that you are editing a group and allow you to navigate back out of the group (you can also use the Escape key). Groups can be nested, as shown below.\nYou can optionally give a group a name via the group\u0026rsquo;s property inspector. This can be helpful when you have a lot of groups and need to \u0026ldquo;know where you are\u0026rdquo; when you edit their contents. Naming and grouping controls is also the first step to creating Symbols.\nCropping Groups It is possible to crop (mask) a group of controls to only show a selected portion of it. When a group is selected, a crop icon will show in the Property Inspector. Click on it to edit the visible area of the group.\nThe video below illustrates how to use this feature.\n "

This can be useful when you already have content in your mockups but want to use a different control type without re-typing the content (changing a text input to a combo box, for example).\nJust click on a control and open the context menu next to the control name in the Property Inspector to see which control types the selected control can be transformed to. Select the control you want to convert it to or use the search to look for it.\nYou can transform controls quickly using the shortcut CTRL+T to bring up the transform menu in the center of the canvas.\nSee the video below for a demonstration.\n Grouping UI Controls Sometimes you might want to group some controls to better align them or move them all at once.

You will then be able to crop it. \u0026ldquo;Drawing\u0026rdquo; Basic Controls There are three controls that you can add to the canvas by \u0026ldquo;drawing\u0026rdquo; them with your mouse while holding down a letter key. To quickly draw a rectangle on the canvas, hold down the R key and drag your mouse. Holding down T instead will draw a block of text, and Y will produce a line of text.\nSee the video below for a demonstration.\n After you\u0026rsquo;ve added these controls, you can easily convert them to other controls by using the transform menu described above.\n"
