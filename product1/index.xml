      <title>Introduction to Balsamiq Cloud</title>

      <description>What Is Balsamiq Cloud? Balsamiq Cloud is a web-based user interface design tool for creating wireframes (sometimes called mockups or low-fidelity prototypes). You can use it to generate digital sketches of your idea or concept for an application or website, to facilitate discussion and understanding before any code is written. The completed wireframes can be used for user testing, clarifying your vision, getting feedback from stakeholders, or getting approval to start development.</description>

      <title>Managing Spaces</title>

      <description>A Space on Balsamiq Cloud is where your projects live. We have three tiers of Spaces, and we think that once you find the right size, a single Space will be enough for you and your team. While there may be situations where you are invited to someone else&amp;rsquo;s Space to collaborate on a project, or you need a specific number of projects, we expect you&amp;rsquo;ll only have to manage a single Space.</description>

      <description>In each of your Spaces, you will find a collection of projects that you and your team are working on.
From this page you can create and upload as many projects as your subscription allows. If you have existing Balsamiq (.bmpr) files you can just drag them on to this screen to upload them.
Note: If you were invited to join a Space, it is likely that there will be projects available to you already.</description>

      <description>A Balsamiq Cloud account is your ticket to super-fast wireframing. You only need one account as it can belong to as many spaces as you make, or are invited to.
Signing Up for a Balsamiq Cloud Account The first thing you need to do to start working in Balsamiq Cloud is sign up for an account. To get started, head over to https://balsamiq.cloud.
We offer two sign up methods. You can complete our sign up form:</description>

      <description>Balsamiq Cloud is designed for collaboration and offers many ways for you to get feedback on your designs. This document outlines a few different ways so that you can pick the right one to fit each situation.
For sharing with collaborators, just have your Space Owner invite them as staff members. Once they’re set up as staff members on your Balsamiq Cloud Space, you can quickly invite them to projects.</description>

      <description>Importing Wireframes from Another Cloud Project Sometimes you might want to copy or move a wireframe from one project to another. Here is a simple way to do it:
 Open the two projects (each in its own browser tab or window) In the source project, select the wireframe you want to copy or move. Select all the controls from this wireframe (CTRL/CMD+A) and copy the controls (CTRL/CMD+C) In the target project, paste your controls (CTRL/CMD+V) in a newly created wireframe  That’s it!</description>

      <title>Balsamiq Cloud Terms of Use and Privacy Policy</title>
      <link>https://mmclssg1.github.io/ssdocs/product1/tos/</link>

      <description>Please read this document carefully before accessing or using Balsamiq Cloud.
Introduction English, Not Legalese Most Terms of Use and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable. They are written by lawyers and for lawyers, and in our opinion are not very effective.
Because we believe in establishing long-term relationships with our customers, we decided to use plain English instead as much as possible, to make our terms as clear as possible.</description>
